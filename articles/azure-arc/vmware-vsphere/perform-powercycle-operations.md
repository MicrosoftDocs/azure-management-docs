# Perform powercycle operations on VMware vCenter managed virtual machines in Azure 

In this article, you learn how to perform power cycle operations such as start, stop, and restart on the Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere Virtual Machines. 

## Prerequisites 

Before you perform power cycle operations on a VM, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites: 

- The VMware vCenter is in a *Connected* state and its associated Azure Arc resource bridge is in a *Running* state. 
- The VM, which is operated from Azure is [enabled for management in Azure](browse-and-enable-vcenter-resources-in-azure.md). 
- *Azure Arc VMware VM Contributor* role or a custom Azure role with permissions to make any changes to the VMware vSphere VMs on which you want to perform the power operations. 

## Perform power cycle operations 

To perform power cycle operations, follow these steps: 

1. Sign in to theâ€¯[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to **Azure Arc** > **VMware vCenters** and then select the VMware vCenter, which manages the VM that you're planning to operate from Azure. 

2. Navigate to the dedicated **Virtual machines** inventory view under the vCenter inventory. Alternatively, you can navigate to the inventory view for VMs enabled for management in Azure from **Azure Arc** > **Machines** blade.

3. Select the machine on which you want to perform power cycle operations. 

   You can now perform the following power cycle operations: 

    - **Start**: Select **Start** > **Yes** to start the machine. 
    - **Restart**: Select **Restart** > **Yes** to restart the machine. 
    - **Stop**: Select **Stop** > **Yes** to stop the machine.

You can track the progress of the Azure operations from the Azure [activity log](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ActivityLog/ActivityLogBlade).
