    questions:
      - question: If I installed the 1.2.0-preview or any earlier release, how do I uninstall the extension? 
        answer: |
          If you previously installed a version of Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc earlier than **2.1.0-preview**, you must uninstall that previous instance in order to install the newer version.

          > [!NOTE]
          > The extension name for Azure Container Storage was previously **Edge Storage Accelerator**. If you still have this instance installed, the extension is referred to as **microsoft.edgestorageaccelerator** in the Azure portal.

          1. Before you can delete the extension, you must delete your configPods, Persistent Volume Claims, and Persistent Volumes using the following commands in this order. Replace `YOUR_POD_FILE_NAME_HERE`, `YOUR_PVC_FILE_NAME_HERE`, and `YOUR_PV_FILE_NAME_HERE` with your respective file names. If you have more than one of each type, add one line per instance:

            ```bash
            kubectl delete -f "YOUR_POD_FILE_NAME_HERE.yaml"
            kubectl delete -f "YOUR_PVC_FILE_NAME_HERE.yaml"
            kubectl delete -f "YOUR_PV_FILE_NAME_HERE.yaml"
            ```

          2. After you delete your configPods, PVCs, and PVs in the previous step, you can uninstall the extension using the following command. Replace `YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_HERE`, `YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME_HERE`, and `YOUR_EXTENSION_NAME_HERE` with your respective information:

            ```azurecli
            az k8s-extension delete --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_HERE --cluster-name YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME_HERE --cluster-type connectedClusters --name YOUR_EXTENSION_NAME_HERE
            ```

          3. If you installed the extension before the **1.1.0-preview** release (released on 4/19/24) and have a preexisting `config.json` file, the `config.json` schema changed. Remove the old `config.json` file using `rm config.json`.

      - question: What types of encryption are used by Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc?
        answer: |
          There are three types of encryption that might be interesting for an Azure Container Storage customer:

          - **Cluster to Blob Encryption**: Data in transit from the cluster to blob is encrypted using standard HTTPS protocols. Data is decrypted once it reaches the cloud.
          - **Encryption Between Nodes**: This encryption is covered by Open Service Mesh (OSM) that is installed as part of setting up your Azure Container Storage cluster. It uses standard TLS encryption protocols.
          - **On Disk Encryption**: Encryption at rest. Not currently supported by Azure Container Storage.

      - question: Is data encrypted in transit?
        answer: Yes, data in transit is encrypted using standard HTTPS protocols. Data is decrypted once it reaches the cloud.

      - question: Is data encrypted at REST?
        answer: Data persisted by the Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc extension is encrypted at REST if the underlying platform provides encrypted disks.

      - question: What is ACStor triplication?
        answer: ACStor triplication stores data across three different nodes, each with its own hard drive. This intended behavior ensures data redundancy and reliability.

      - question: Can ACStor triplication occur on a single physical device?
        answer: No, ACStor triplication isn't designed to operate on a single physical device with three attached hard drives.

      - question: Does Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc support ARM deployments? 
        answer: No, at this time, Arc itself does not support ARM, so neither does this Arc extension.

      - question: When using Extension Identity, permissions as a StorageBlobDataOwner role are needed to write data. Is there a reason it needs Owner instead of just Contributor?
        answer: Yes, the `StorageBlobDataOwner` role is required for metadata operations to store extended attributes.
