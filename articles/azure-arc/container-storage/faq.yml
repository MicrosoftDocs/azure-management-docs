  This article provides a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) for Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc and their answers.

    questions:
      - question: If I installed the 1.2.0-preview or any earlier release, how do I uninstall the extension? 
        answer: |
          If you previously installed a version of Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc earlier than **2.1.0-preview**, you must uninstall that previous instance in order to install the newer version.

          > [!NOTE]
          > The extension name for Azure Container Storage was previously **Edge Storage Accelerator**. If you still have this instance installed, the extension is referred to as **microsoft.edgestorageaccelerator** in the Azure portal.

          1. Before you can delete the extension, you must delete your configPods, Persistent Volume Claims, and Persistent Volumes using the following commands in this order. Replace `YOUR_POD_FILE_NAME_HERE`, `YOUR_PVC_FILE_NAME_HERE`, and `YOUR_PV_FILE_NAME_HERE` with your respective file names. If you have more than one of each type, add one line per instance:

            ```bash
            kubectl delete -f "YOUR_POD_FILE_NAME_HERE.yaml"
            kubectl delete -f "YOUR_PVC_FILE_NAME_HERE.yaml"
            kubectl delete -f "YOUR_PV_FILE_NAME_HERE.yaml"
            ```

          2. After you delete your configPods, PVCs, and PVs in the previous step, you can uninstall the extension using the following command. Replace `YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_HERE`, `YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME_HERE`, and `YOUR_EXTENSION_NAME_HERE` with your respective information:

            ```azurecli
            az k8s-extension delete --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_HERE --cluster-name YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME_HERE --cluster-type connectedClusters --name YOUR_EXTENSION_NAME_HERE
            ```

          3. If you installed the extension before the **1.1.0-preview** release (released on 4/19/24) and have a preexisting `config.json` file, the `config.json` schema changed. Remove the old `config.json` file using `rm config.json`.

      - question: What types of encryption are used by Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc?
        answer: |
          There are three types of encryption that might be interesting for an Azure Container Storage customer:

          - **Cluster to Blob Encryption**: Data in transit from the cluster to blob is encrypted using standard HTTPS protocols. Data is decrypted once it reaches the cloud.
          - **Encryption Between Nodes**: This encryption is covered by Open Service Mesh (OSM) that is installed as part of setting up your Azure Container Storage cluster. It uses standard TLS encryption protocols.
          - **On Disk Encryption**: Encryption at rest. Not currently supported by Azure Container Storage.

      - question: Is data encrypted in transit?
        answer: Yes, data in transit is encrypted using standard HTTPS protocols. Data is decrypted once it reaches the cloud.

      - question: Is data encrypted at REST?
        answer: Data persisted by the Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc extension is encrypted at REST if the underlying platform provides encrypted disks.

      - question: What is ACStor triplication?
        answer: ACStor triplication stores data across three different nodes, each with its own hard drive. This intended behavior ensures data redundancy and reliability.

      - question: Can ACStor triplication occur on a single physical device?
        answer: No, ACStor triplication isn't designed to operate on a single physical device with three attached hard drives.

      - question: Does Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc support ARM deployments? 
        answer: No, at this time, Arc itself does not support ARM, so neither does this Arc extension.

      - question: When using Extension Identity, permissions as a StorageBlobDataOwner role are needed to write data. Is there a reason it needs Owner instead of just Contributor?
        answer: Yes, the `StorageBlobDataOwner` role is required for metadata operations to store extended attributes.

      - question: Is there a limit to how many files can be in a Local Shared Volume? How about an Ingest subvolume?
        answer: |
          The maximum number of files allowed in a Local Shared Volume is tied to the underlying storage limits. The maximum number of files is roughly 65,000 for every 1GB of provisioned storage capacity. Ingest subvolumes are subject to the same storage specific limitations (for example, 65,000 for every 1GB of provisioned storage capacity); however, they also have an upper limit based on metadata storage capacity. This limit is roughly 1.5-1.75 million files total. 
          
          It's important to note that this limit only applies to files currently stored in the subvolume. Generally, files are uploaded then purged. Therefore, this limit is mainly of note during disconnected scenarios or for subvolumes with long retention policies.
