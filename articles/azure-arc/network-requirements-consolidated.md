# Azure Arc network requirements

This article lists the endpoints, ports, and protocols required for Azure Arc-enabled services and features.

[!INCLUDE [network-requirement-principles](includes/network-requirement-principles.md)]

> [!TIP]
> For the Azure public cloud, you can reduce the number of required endpoints by using the Azure Arc gateway for [Arc-enabled servers](servers/arc-gateway.md) or [Arc-enabled Kubernetes](kubernetes/arc-gateway-simplify-networking.md).

## Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes endpoints

Connectivity to the Arc Kubernetes-based endpoints is required for all Kubernetes-based Arc offerings, including:

- Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes
- Azure Container Apps on Azure Arc
- Azure Arc-enabled Machine Learning
- Azure Arc-enabled data services (direct connectivity mode only)

[!INCLUDE [network-requirements](kubernetes/includes/network-requirements.md)]

For more information, see [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes network requirements](kubernetes/network-requirements.md).

## Azure Arc-enabled data services

This section describes requirements specific to Azure Arc-enabled data services, in addition to the Arc-enabled Kubernetes endpoints listed above.

[!INCLUDE [network-requirements](data/includes/network-requirements.md)]

For more information, see [Connectivity modes and requirements](data/connectivity.md).

## Azure Arc-enabled servers

Connectivity to Arc-enabled server endpoints is required for:

- SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc
- Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere <sup>*</sup>
- Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager <sup>*</sup>
- Azure Arc-enabled Azure Stack (HCI) <sup>*</sup>

   <sup>*</sup>Only required for guest management enabled.

[!INCLUDE [network-requirements](servers/includes/network-requirements.md)]

### Subset of endpoints for ESU only

[!INCLUDE [esu-network-requirements](servers/includes/esu-network-requirements.md)]

For more information, see [Connected Machine agent network requirements](servers/network-requirements.md).

## Azure Arc resource bridge

This section describes additional networking requirements specific to deploying Azure Arc resource bridge in your enterprise. These requirements also apply to Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere and Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager.

[!INCLUDE [network-requirements](resource-bridge/includes/network-requirements.md)]

For more information, see [Azure Arc resource bridge network requirements](resource-bridge/network-requirements.md).

## Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere

Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere also requires:

[!INCLUDE [network-requirements](vmware-vsphere/includes/network-requirements.md)]

For more information, see [Support matrix for Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere](vmware-vsphere/support-matrix-for-arc-enabled-vmware-vsphere.md).

## Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager

Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) also requires:

| **Service** | **Port** | **URL** | **Direction** | **Notes**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SCVMM management Server | 443 | URL of the SCVMM management server | Appliance VM IP and control plane endpoint need outbound connection. | Used by the SCVMM server to communicate with the Appliance VM and the control plane. |

For more information, see [Overview of Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager](system-center-virtual-machine-manager/overview.md).

## Additional endpoints

Depending on your scenario, you might need connectivity to other URLs, such as those used by the Azure portal, management tools, or other Azure services. In particular, review these lists to ensure that you allow connectivity to any necessary endpoints:

- [Azure portal URLs](../azure-portal/azure-portal-safelist-urls.md)
- [Azure CLI endpoints for proxy bypass](/cli/azure/azure-cli-endpoints)
