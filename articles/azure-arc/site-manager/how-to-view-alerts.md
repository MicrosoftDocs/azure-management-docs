# How to view alert status for an Azure Arc site

This article details how to view the alert status for an Azure Arc site. A site's alert status reflects the status of the underlying resources. From the site status view, you can find detailed status information for the supported resources as well.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have a service subscription, create a [free trial account in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Azure portal access
* Internet connectivity
* A resource group or subscription in Azure with at least one resource for a site. For more information, see [Supported resource types](./overview.md#supported-resource-types).
* A site created for the associated resource group or subscription. If you don't have one, see [Create and manage sites](./how-to-crud-site.md).

## Alert status colors and meanings

In the Azure portal, status is indicated using color.

* Green: **Up to Date**
* Blue: **Info**
* Purple: **Verbose**
* Yellow: **Warning**
* Orange: **Error**
* Red: **Critical**
