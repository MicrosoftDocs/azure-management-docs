This article details how to view the connectivity status for an Arc site. A site's connectivity status reflects the status of the underlying resources. From the site status view, you can find detailed status information for the supported resources as well.

## Prerequisites

* Azure portal access
* Internet connectivity
* A resource group or subscription in Azure with at least one resource for a site. For more information, see [Supported resource types](./overview.md#supported-resource-types).
* A site created for the associated resource group or subscription. If you don't have one, see [Create and manage sites](./how-to-crud-site.md).
