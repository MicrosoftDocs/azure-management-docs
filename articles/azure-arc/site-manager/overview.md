# What is Azure Arc site manager (preview)?

Azure Arc site manager allows you to manage and monitor your on-premises environments as Azure Arc *sites*. Arc sites are scoped to an Azure resource group or subscription and enable you to track connectivity, alerts, and updates across your environment. The experience is tailored for on-premises scenarios where infrastructure is often managed within a common physical boundary, such as a store, restaurant, or factory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Arc site manager is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Set an Arc site scope

When you create a site, you scope it to either a resource group or a subscription. The site automatically pulls in any supported resources within its scope.

Arc sites currently have a 1:1 relationship with resource groups and subscriptions. Any given Arc site can only be associated to one resource group or subscription, and vice versa. 

You can create a hierarchy of sites by creating one site for a subscription and more sites for the resource groups within the subscription. The following screenshot shows an example of a hierarchy, with sites for **Los Angeles**, **San Francisco**, and **New York** nested within the site **United States**.

With site manager, customers who manage on-premises infrastructure can view resources based on their physical site or location. Sites don't logically have to be associated with a physical grouping. You can use sites in whatever way supports your scenario. For example, you could create a site that groups resources by function or type rather than location.

## Supported resource types

Currently, site manager supports the following Azure resources with the following capabilities:

| Resource | Inventory | Connectivity status | Updates | Alerts |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Azure Local | ![Checkmark icon - Inventory status supported for Azure Stack HCI.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Connectivity status supported for Azure Stack HCI.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Updates supported for Azure Stack HCI.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) (Minimum OS required: HCI 23H2) | ![Checkmark icon - Alerts supported for Azure Stack HCI.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) |
| Arc-enabled Servers | ![Checkmark icon - Inventory status supported for Arc for Servers.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Connectivity status supported for Arc for Servers.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Updates supported for Arc for Servers.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Alerts supported for Arc for Servers.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) |
| Arc-enabled VMs | ![Checkmark icon - Inventory status supported for Arc VMs.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Connectivity status supported for Arc VMs.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Update status supported for Arc VMs.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Alerts supported for Arc VMs.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) |
| Arc-enabled Kubernetes | ![Checkmark icon - Inventory status supported for Arc enabled Kubernetes.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Connectivity status supported for Arc enabled Kubernetes.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) |  | ![Checkmark icon - Alerts supported for Arc enabled Kubernetes.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) |
| Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) hybrid | ![Checkmark icon - Inventory status supported for AKS.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Connectivity status supported for AKS.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) | ![Checkmark icon - Update status supported for AKS.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) (only provisioned clusters) | ![Checkmark icon - Alerts supported for AKS.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) |
| Assets | ![Checkmark icon - Inventory status supported for Assets.](./media/overview/yes-icon.svg) |  |  |  |

Site manager only provides status aggregation for the supported resource types. Site manager doesn't manage resources of other types that exist in the resource group or subscription, but those resources continue to function normally otherwise.

## Regions

Site manager supports resources that exist in [supported regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=azure-arc&regions=all), with a few exceptions. For the following regions, connectivity and update status aren't supported for Arc-enabled machines or Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters:

* Brazil South
* UAE North
* South Africa North

## Pricing

Site manager is free to use, but integrates with other Azure services that have their own pricing models. For your managed resources and monitoring configuration, including Azure Monitor alerts, refer to the individual service's pricing page.
