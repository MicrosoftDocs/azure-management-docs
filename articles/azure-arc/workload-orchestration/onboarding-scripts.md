# Onboarding scripts for workload orchestration

The onboarding PowerShell scripts are designed to help you set up the necessary infrastructure and resources for workload orchestration in Azure Arc. The scripts automate the process of creating a Kubernetes cluster, deploying on the cluster, creating custom location and site, and installing the workload orchestration CLI extension.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer to not use the scripts and want to do the setup manually, you can follow the instruction in [Prepare the environment for workload orchestration](initial-setup-environment.md) and [Setup workload orchestration](initial-setup-configuration.md).

## Prerequisites

- Run `winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI` and `winget install -e --id Kubernetes.kubectl`.
- Download and extract the artifacts from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/workload-orchestration/blob/main/workload%20orchestration%20files.zip) into a particular folder. From the compressed folder, you find the following files:
    - Download the workload-orchestration CLI extension.
    - Download the JSON files for site-address and site content, schemas, configs, *onboarding-data.json* and *mock-data.json*.
    - Edit the `onboarding-data.json` file. You can find mock data in `mock-data.json`.

## Common variables in input JSON

The following fields are common to both the `cmOnboarding` and `infraOnboarding` sections in the input JSON file. These fields are used to define the common resource group, subscription ID, and location for the resources being created. If you want to use a common resource group, subscription ID, or location for both CM and infra resources, you can set them in the common section. Otherwise, you can override them in the `cmOnboarding` or `infraOnboarding` sections.

- `subscriptionId`: (Optional) When using a common subscription ID, don't override this field in the `cmOnboarding` or `infraOnboarding` section.
- `resourceGroup`: (Optional) When using a common resource group, don't override this field in the `cmOnboarding` or `infraOnboarding` section.
- `location`: (Optional) When using a common location, don't override this field in the `cmOnboarding` or `infraOnboarding` section.
- `customLocationFile`: Automatically added by the onboarding script, don't modify it when running the custom location onboarding script.

## Infra onboarding

The infra setup script helps you onboard to the infrastructure needed for workload orchestration, such as creating an AKS cluster, deploying TCO on the cluster, creating custom location and site, and finally installing the workload orchestration CLI extension.

Open a PowerShell terminal and run the following command.

- **Command**: `infra_onboarding.ps1 mock-data.json`
- **Arguments**: 
    - `-skipResourceGroupCreation`: Skip creation of the resource group.
    - `-skipAzLogin`: Skip Azure login, use when you are already logged in.
    - `-skipAzExtensions`: Skip installing/updating `connectedk8s`, `k8s-extension` and `customlocation` extensions.
    - `-skipAksCreation`: Skip creation of AKS cluster, use when the cluster is already created.
    - `-skipTcoDeployment`: Skip connecting AKS to Arc and creation of TCO extension, use when TCO has been deployed already.
    - `-skipCustomLocationCreation`: Skip creation of CustomLocation, use when it has been created before.
    - `-skipConnectedRegistryDeployment`: Skip connected registry deployment. By default, this step is skipped. Set to false when user need to deploy the connected registry on AKS cluster for staging. 
    - `-skipSiteCreation`: Skip creation of Site and SiteAddress, use when it has been created before.
    - `-skipAutoParsing`: Skip auto-creation of custom location file and auto-parsing of site file. By default, you don't need to set the "addressResourceId" field in the site file and do not need to pass a customLocationFile in the target data section. Set to `$true` if you want to assign your own custom location (not created via onboarding script) or your own site address (not created via onboarding script).
    - `-enableWODiagnostics`: Enable workload orchestration extension user-facing logs, use when you want to collect workload orchestration extension user audits and user diagnostics logs. For more information, see [Diagnose edge-related logs and errors](diagnose-problems.md).
    - `-enableContainerInsights`: Enable `Container.Insights` on arc cluster to collect container logs and k8s events. Use when you want to collect container logs or k8s events. For more information, see [Diagnose edge-related logs and errors](diagnose-problems.md).

> [!NOTE]
>  All arguments are boolean which take `$true`/`$false` as values and the default value is `$false`, except for `-skipAzLogin` and `-skipConnectedRegistryDeployment` which are `$true` by default. 

## Context creation script (only if there is no existing context)

Context creation is a one-time operation. If you have already created a context, you can skip this step. If you need to create a new context, use the following command:

```powershell
# One context per tenant 
az workload-orchestration context create `
 --resource-group <Context-ResourceGroup> `
 --location <Location> `
 --name <ContextName> `
 --capabilities [0].name="$resourcePrefix-soap2" [0].description="$resourcePrefix-Soap2" [1].name="$resourcePrefix-shampoo2" [1].description="$resourcePrefix-Shampoo2" `
 --hierarchies [0].name=factory [0].description=Factory [1].name=line [1].description=Line
```

Once you create the context, add the required data in *onboarding-data.json* file. The context creation script doesn't run again, so you need to add the context details in the onboarding data JSON file.

```json
        "contextResourceGroup": "",
        "contextName": "",
        "contextSubscriptionId": "",
        "contextLocation": "",  
```
