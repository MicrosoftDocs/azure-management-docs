# Use Azure portal to monitor your solutions as an IT developer

IT DevOps can use the Azure portal to monitor their solutions. In the Azure portal, you can:

- View the applications on lines and their statuses.
- View alerts related to deployment.
- Trace the issues causing failures.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Open workload orchestration page

1. Go to the [**workload orchestration** page in Azure Arc](https://aka.ms/configManager).
1. The workload orchestration page has two tabs: **Deployment alerts** and **All resources**. Deployment alerts tab provides the list of issues to be debugged. All resources tab lists all the sites, K8 clusters and deployment targets.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The workload orchestration page is only available via [the direct link](https://aka.ms/configManager). 

1. In the **Deployment alerts** tab, you can see the list of deployment alerts. The list shows the target name, type, and other details.
1. Click on the name of the target to view the details of the alert.

1. The alert summary shows the operation name, solution, fired time and affected targets.

## Monitor all resources

1. In the **All resources** tab, the default view shows the flattened list of sites and targets.

1. In the **Hierarchy level** column, you can see the hierarchy level of the resources. Workload orchestration allows you to have an organization with a minimum of two and a maximum of four levels of hierarchy. For more information, see [Service groups at different hierarchy levels in workload orchestration](service-group.md#service-groups-at-different-hierarchy-levels).

1. Click on **View solutions**.

1. The new view shows the list of solutions and statuses across targets.

1. Click on **View targets** to go back to the previous list of targets.
1. Click on **Create site** to create a new site. For more information, see [Create a site in Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/site-manager/how-to-crud-site#create-a-site).
