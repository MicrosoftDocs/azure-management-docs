# Customer intent: "As an IT administrator managing workload orchestration, I want to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using standard and custom roles, so that I can ensure secure and appropriate access for users based on their responsibilities."

# Role Based Access Control (RBAC) guide for workload orchestration

This article describes how you can set up RBAC when using workload orchestration. Standard Azure RBAC is compatible with workload orchestration since all objects are ARM-based. You can use either the Azure Standard Built-in Roles (Owner, Reader, and Contributor) or a Custom Defined Role to support various combinations of actions suitable for their organization.

For more information, see [Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles).

## Use standard built-in roles

Workload orchestration supports the following standard built-in roles. These roles are defined at the Resource Group level, and you can assign them to users, groups, or service principals. The following table describes the roles and their scopes:

|Role	|Scope	|Comments|
|---	|---	|---	|
|Owner	|Resource Group	|They can create/update/delete workload orchestration Resources in the Resource Group.|
|Reader	|Resource Group	|They can read all workload orchestration Resources in the Resource Group.|
|Contributor| Resource Group| They can create/update capabilities, solutions, sites, schemas, author configuration, deploy, and rollback.|

## Create custom roles 

You can define custom roles based on Azure RBAC guidelines to meet your organization's specific needs. Workload orchestration allows you to create custom roles by enabling the following actions on the associated resources for different objects. 

The following table provides a summary of the roles you can create and the actions you can assign to them:

|Role |Description|Actions|
|---|---|---|
|Admin|Full access to all workload orchestration resources and actions|Use Azure Core Contributor role|

### RBAC for service groups

The following table shows recommended actions for different user roles when using a custom-defined role at a service group level. For more information about service groups, see [Service groups for workload orchestration](service-group.md).

#### Service group contributor​

A service group contributor​ is the admin user who creates the service group and is responsible for setting up the entire service group and Sites hierarchy​

|Description|Actions|
|---|---|
|Create and manage service groups \*| `Microsoft.Management/serviceGroups/read​`, `Microsoft.Management/serviceGroups/write​`, `Microsoft.Management/serviceGroups/delete​`|
|Create and manage relationships on top of `DeploymentTargets`| `Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/read` on `DeploymentTarget` + Target service group​, `Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/write` on `DeploymentTarget` + Target service group​, `Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/delete` on `DeploymentTarget` + Target service group​|
|View the resources under the service group|Ensure that the user has READ access to the `DeploymentTarget` resources that are part of the service group. For this, the user can either have access at the resource group/subscription level or directly for the particular `DeploymentTarget` resource.​|

\* User needs to be a registered user on the Tenant. Once a user creates a service group, they automatically create the following permissions on the service group. 

#### Service group reader

A service group reader is any user who can view the service groups and sites hierarchy​.

|Description|Actions|
|---|---|
|View service groups by service group contributor​ | `Microsoft.Management/serviceGroups/read​`|
|View already existing relationships on top of `DeploymentTargets`| `Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/read` on `DeploymentTarget` + Target service group​|
|View the resources under the service group|Ensure that the user has READ access to the `DeploymentTarget` resources that are part of the service group. For this, the user can either have access at the resource group/subscription level or directly for the particular `DeploymentTarget` resource.​|

#### Service group admin​

A service group admin is any user who can view, edit, and delete the service groups created by the service group contributor​​.

|Description|Actions|
|---|---|
|Create and manage service groups| `Microsoft.Management/serviceGroups/read​`, `Microsoft.Management/serviceGroups/write​`, `Microsoft.Management/serviceGroups/delete​`|
|Create and manage relationships on top of `DeploymentTargets`| `Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/read` on `DeploymentTarget` + Target service group​, `Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/write` on `DeploymentTarget` + Target service group​, `Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/delete` on `DeploymentTarget` + Target service group​|
|View the resources under the service group| Ensure that the user has READ access to the `DeploymentTarget` resources that are part of the service group. For this, the user can either have access at the resource group/subscription level or directly for the particular `DeploymentTarget` resource.​|
