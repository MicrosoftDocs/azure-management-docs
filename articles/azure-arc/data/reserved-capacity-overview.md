# Reserved capacity - SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc

Save money with SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc by committing to a reservation for Azure Arc services compared to pay-as-you-go prices. With reserved capacity, you make a commitment for SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc use for one or three years to get a significant discount on the service fee. To purchase reserved capacity, you need to specify the Azure region, deployment type, performance tier, and term.

You do not need to assign the reservation to a specific database or managed instance. Matching existing deployments that are already running or ones that are newly deployed automatically get the benefit. By purchasing a reservation, you commit to usage for the Azure Arc services cost for one or three years. As soon as you buy a reservation, the service charges that match the reservation attributes are no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates. 

A reservation applies to Azure Arc services cost only and does not cover SQL IP costs or any other charges. At the end of the reservation term, the billing benefit expires and the managed instance is billed at the pay-as-you go price. Reservations do not automatically renew. For pricing information, see the [reserved capacity offering](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/managed/).

You can buy reserved capacity in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_GTM/ModernBillingMenuBlade/reservationsBrowse). Pay for the reservation [up front or with monthly payments](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/prepare-buy-reservation). To buy reserved capacity:

- You must be in the owner role for at least one Enterprise or individual subscription with pay-as-you-go rates.
- For Enterprise subscriptions, **Add Reserved Instances** must be enabled in the [EA portal](https://ea.azure.com). Or, if that setting is disabled, you must be an EA Admin on the subscription. Reserved capacity.

For more information about how enterprise customers and pay-as-you-go customers are charged for reservation purchases, see [Understand Azure reservation usage for your Enterprise enrollment](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage-ea) and [Understand Azure reservation usage for your Pay-As-You-Go subscription](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage).

## Determine correct size before purchase

The size of reservation should be based on the total amount of compute resources measured in vCores used by the existing or soon-to-be-deployed managed instances within a specific region reservation scope.

The following list demonstrates a scenario to project how you would reserve resources: 

* **Current**: 
  - One General Purpose, 16 vCore managed instance
  - Two Business Critical, 8-vCore managed instances

* **In the next year you will add**: 
  - One more General Purpose, 16 vCore managed instance
  - One more Business Critical, 32 vCore managed instance

* **Purchase a reservations for**:
  - 32 (2x16) vCore one year reservation for General Purpose managed instance
  - 48 (2x8 + 32) vCore one year reservation for Business Critical managed instance 

## Buy reserved capacity

2. Select **All services** > **Reservations**.
3. Select **Add** and then in the **Purchase Reservations** pane, select **SQL Managed Instance** to purchase a new reservation for SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc.

    | Field      | Description|
    |------------|--------------|
    |Subscription|The subscription used to pay for the capacity reservation. The payment method on the subscription is charged the upfront costs for the reservation.

For an enterprise subscription, the charges are deducted from the enrollment's Azure Prepayment (previously called monetary commitment) balance or charged as overage. For an individual subscription with pay-as-you-go pricing, the charges are billed to the credit card or invoice payment method on the subscription.|
    |Scope       |The vCore reservation's scope can cover one subscription or multiple subscriptions (shared scope). If you select <br/><br/>**Shared**, the vCore reservation discount is applied to the database or managed instance running in any subscriptions within your billing context. For enterprise customers, the shared scope is the enrollment and includes all subscriptions within the enrollment. For Pay-As-You-Go customers, the shared scope is all Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions created by the account administrator.<br/><br/>**Single subscription**, the vCore reservation discount is applied to the databases or managed instances in this subscription. <br/><br/>**Single resource group**, the reservation discount is applied to managed instances in the selected subscription in the selected subscription and the selected resource group within that subscription.</br></br>**Management group**, the reservation discount is applied to the managed instances in the list of subscriptions that are a part of both the management group and billing scope.|

    |Quantity    |The amount of compute resources being purchased within the capacity reservation. The quantity is the number of vCores in the selected Azure region and Performance tier that are being reserved and will get the billing discount. For example, if you run or plan to run multiple managed instances with the total compute capacity of Gen5 16 vCores in the East US region, then specify the quantity as 16 to maximize the benefit for all the databases. |
