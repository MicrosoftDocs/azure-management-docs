# SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc - disaster recovery 

To configure disaster recovery in SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc, set up Azure failover groups. This article explains failover groups.

## Background

Azure failover groups use the same distributed availability groups technology that is in SQL Server. Because SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc runs on Kubernetes, there's no Windows failover cluster involved.  For more information, see [Distributed availability groups](/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/distributed-availability-groups).

> [!NOTE]
> - The instances in both geo-primary and geo-secondary sites need to be identical in terms of their compute & capacity, as well as service tiers they are deployed in.
> - Distributed availability groups can be set up for either General Purpose or Business Critical service tiers. 

You can configure failover groups in with the CLI or in the portal. For prerequisites and instructions see the respective content below:

- [Configure failover group - portal](managed-instance-disaster-recovery-portal.md)
- [Configure failover group - CLI](managed-instance-disaster-recovery-cli.md)
