# What are Azure Arc-enabled data services?

Azure Arc makes it possible to run Azure data services on-premises, at the edge, and in public clouds using Kubernetes and the infrastructure of your choice.

Currently, the following Azure Arc-enabled data services are available: 

- SQL Managed Instance

For an introduction to how Azure Arc-enabled data services supports your hybrid work environment, see this introductory video:

## Always current

Azure Arc-enabled data services such as SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc receive updates on a frequent basis including servicing patches and new features similar to the experience in Azure. Updates from the Microsoft Container Registry are provided to you and deployment cadences are set by you in accordance with your policies. This way, on-premises databases can stay up to date while ensuring you maintain control. Because Azure Arc-enabled data services are a subscription service, you will no longer face end-of-support situations for your databases.

## Elastic scale

Cloud-like elasticity on-premises enables you to scale databases up or down dynamically in much the same way as they do in Azure, based on the available capacity of your infrastructure. This capability can satisfy burst scenarios that have volatile needs, including scenarios that require ingesting and querying data in real time, at any scale, with sub-second response time.

## Self-service provisioning

Azure Arc also provides other cloud benefits such as fast deployment and automation at scale. Thanks to Kubernetes-based orchestration, you can deploy a database in seconds using either GUI or CLI tools.

## Unified management

Using familiar tools such as the Azure portal, Azure Data Studio, and the Azure CLI (`az`) with the `arcdata` extension, you can now gain a unified view of all your data assets deployed with Azure Arc. You are able to not only view and manage a variety of relational databases across your environment and Azure, but also get logs and telemetry from Kubernetes APIs to analyze the underlying infrastructure capacity and health. Besides having localized log analytics and performance monitoring, you can now leverage Azure Monitor for comprehensive operational insights across your entire estate.
