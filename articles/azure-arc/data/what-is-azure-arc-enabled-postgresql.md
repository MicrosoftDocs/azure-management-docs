# What is Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL server

[!INCLUDE [azure-arc-data-preview](./includes/azure-arc-data-preview.md)]

**Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL server** is one of the database engines available as part of Azure Arc-enabled data services. 

## Compare PostgreSQL solutions provided by Microsoft in Azure

Microsoft offers PostgreSQL database services in Azure in two ways:
- As a managed service in **[Azure PaaS](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.PostgreSQLServer)** (Platform As A Service)
- As a customer-managed service with Azure Arc as it is operated by customers or their partners/vendors

### Features

- Manage PostgreSQL simply
- Simplify monitoring, back up, patching/upgrade, access control & more
- Deploy PostgreSQL on any [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) infrastructure
    - On-premises
    - Cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure
    - Edge deployments (including lightweight Kubernetes [K3S](https://k3s.io/))
- Integrate with Azure
    - Direct connectivity mode - Deploy Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL server from the Azure portal
    - Indirect connectivity mode - Deploy Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL server from the infrastructure that hosts it
- Secure
    - Supports Active Directory
    - Server and Client TLS
    - System and user managed certificates
- Pay for what you use (per usage billing)
- Get support from Microsoft on PostgreSQL

## Architecture

Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL server is the community version of the [PostgreSQL 14](https://www.postgresql.org/) server with a curated set of available extensions. Most PostgreSQL applications workloads should be capable of running against Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL server using standard drivers.
