# Customer intent: "As a data engineer, I want to set up an Azure Arc data controller with the necessary tools, so that I can manage and deploy data services across hybrid environments."
---

## Prerequisites

Before you can proceed with the tasks in this article, you need to have the necessary tools. All deployments require the following tools:

- Azure CLI (`az`)
- `arcdata` extension for Azure CLI
- `kubectl`

   Additional client tools depending your environment. For a more comprehensive list, see [Client tools](../install-client-tools.md).

In addition to the required tools, to complete the tasks, you need [an Azure Arc data controller](../plan-azure-arc-data-services.md).
