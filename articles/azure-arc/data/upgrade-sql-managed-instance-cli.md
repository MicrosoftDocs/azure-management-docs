# Upgrade Azure SQL Managed Instance indirectly connected Azure Arc using the CLI

This article describes how to upgrade a SQL Managed Instance deployed on an indirectly connected Azure Arc-enabled data controller using the Azure CLI (`az`).

## Prerequisites

### Install tools

Before you can proceed with the tasks in this article, install:

- The [Azure CLI (`az`)](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- The [`arcdata` extension for Azure CLI](install-arcdata-extension.md)

The `arcdata` extension version and the image version are related. Check that you have the correct `arcdata` extension version that corresponds to the image version you want to upgrade to in the [Version log](version-log.md).

## Limitations

The Azure Arc Data Controller must be upgraded to the new version before the managed instance can be upgraded.

If Active Directory integration is enabled then Active Directory connector must be upgraded to the new version before the managed instance can be upgraded.

The managed instance must be at the same version as the data controller and active directory connector before a data controller is upgraded.

There's no batch upgrade process available at this time.

## Upgrade the managed instance

A dry run can be performed first. The dry run validates the version schema and lists which instance(s) will be upgraded.

For example:

```azurecli
az sql mi-arc upgrade --name <instance name> --k8s-namespace <namespace> --dry-run --use-k8s
```

The output will be:

```output
Preparing to upgrade sql sqlmi-1 in namespace arc to data controller version.
****Dry Run****1 instance(s) would be upgraded by this commandsqlmi-1 would be upgraded to <version-tag>.
```

### Upgrade

To upgrade the managed instance, use the following command:

```azurecli
az sql mi-arc upgrade --name <instance name> --desired-version <version> --k8s-namespace <namespace> --use-k8s
```

Example:

```azurecli
az sql mi-arc upgrade --name instance1 --desired-version v1.0.0.20211028 --k8s-namespace arc1 --use-k8s
```

## Monitor

### CLI

You can monitor the progress of the upgrade with the `show` command.

```cli
az sql mi-arc show --name <instance name> --k8s-namespace <namespace> --use-k8s
```

### Output

The output for the command will show the resource information. Upgrade information will be in Status.

During the upgrade, ```State``` will show ```Updating``` and ```Running Version``` will be the current version:

```output

  Running Version:       v1.0.0_2021-07-30
  State:                 Updating
```

When the upgrade is complete, ```State``` will show ```Ready``` and ```Running Version``` will be the new version:

```output

  State:                 Ready
```
