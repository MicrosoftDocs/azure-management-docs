# Connected Machine agent network requirements

This topic describes the networking requirements for using the Connected Machine agent to onboard a physical server or virtual machine to Azure Arc-enabled servers.

> [!TIP]
> For the Azure public cloud, you can reduce the number of required endpoints by using the [Azure Arc gateway (preview)](arc-gateway.md).
