# Troubleshoot Azure Arc-enabled servers networking issues

This article provides information for troubleshooting networking issues that might occur with Arc-enabled servers.

When troubleshooting connectivity issues, be sure that your environment meets all of the [Azure Arc-enabled servers networking requirements](./agent-overview.md).

## Windows TLS configuration issues

For Azure Connected Machine agent version 1.56 and newer on Windows, if the agent fails to reach Azure endpoints even after the endpoints are whitelisted in the environment, ensure the following cipher suites are enabled for at least one of the recommended TLS versions:

- TLS 1.3 (suites in server-preferred order):
  - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x1302)   ECDH secp521r1 (eq. 15360 bits RSA)   FS
  - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x1301)   ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA)   FS
- TLS 1.2 (suites in server-preferred order)
  - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)   ECDH secp521r1 (eq. 15360 bits RSA)   FS
  - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f)   ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA)   FS

You can check the cipher suites on a machine with the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-TlsCipherSuite | format-list name
```

To enable cipher suites, you can use one of the following methods:

### Enable cipher suites with Group Policy

1. [Open the **SSL Cipher Suite Order** window](/windows-server/security/tls/manage-tls).
1. Edit the **Cipher Suites** box (comma-separated list) to include the minimum required cipher suites.

### Enable cipher suites with PowerShell (no reboot required)

For TLS 1.3:

```powershell
Enable-TlsCipherSuite -Name "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
Enable-TlsCipherSuite -Name "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
```

For TLS 1.2:

```powershell
Enable-TlsCipherSuite -Name "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
Enable-TlsCipherSuite -Name "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
```

### Enable cipher suites with manual Registry edit

1. Navigate to the registry key: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Cryptography\Configuration\Local\SSL\00010002`.
1. Edit the 'Functions' `REG_MULTI_SZ` value to add the required cipher suites to the list (with each cipher suite on its own line).
1. Reboot the machine for changes to take effect.
