# Connect machines at scale with a Configuration Manager custom task sequence

Microsoft Configuration Manager facilitates comprehensive management of servers supporting the secure and scalable deployment of applications, software updates, and operating systems. Configuration Manager offers the custom task sequence as a flexible paradigm for application deployment.

You can use a custom task sequence that can deploy the Connected Machine Agent to onboard a collection of devices to Azure Arc-enabled servers.

Before you get started, be sure to review the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) and verify that your subscription and resources meet the requirements. For information about supported regions and other related considerations, see [supported Azure regions](overview.md#supported-regions). Also review our [at-scale planning guide](plan-at-scale-deployment.md) to understand the design and deployment criteria, as well as our management and monitoring recommendations.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

## Generate a service principal

Follow the steps to [create a service principal for onboarding at scale](onboard-service-principal.md#create-a-service-principal-for-onboarding-at-scale). Assign the **Azure Connected Machine Onboarding** role to your service principal, and limit the scope of the role to the target Azure landing zone. Make a note of the Service Principal ID and Service Principal Secret, as you'll need these values later.

## Download the agent and create the application

First, download the Azure Connected Machine agent package (AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi) for Windows from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://aka.ms/AzureConnectedMachineAgent). The Azure Connected Machine agent for Windows can be [upgraded to the latest release manually or automatically](manage-agent.md), depending on your requirements. The .msi must be saved in a server share for the custom task sequence.

Next, [create an application in Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/apps/get-started/create-and-deploy-an-application) using the installed Azure Connected Machine agent package:

1. In the **Configuration Manager** console, select **Software Library > Application Management > Applications**.
1. On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, select **Create Application**.
1. On the **General** page of the Create Application Wizard, select **Automatically detect information about this application from installation files**. This action pre-populates some of the information in the wizard with information that is extracted from the installation .msi file. Then, specify the following information:
   1. **Type**: Select **Windows Installer (*.msi file)**
   1. **Location**: Select **Browse** to choose the location where you saved the installation file **AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi**.
      :::image type="content" source="media/onboard-configuration-manager-custom-task/configuration-manager-create-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create Application Wizard in Configuration Manager.":::
1. Select **Next**, and on the **Import Information** page, select **Next** again.
1. On the **General Information** page, you can supply further information about the application to help you sort and locate it in the Configuration Manager console. Once complete, select Next.
1. On the **Installation program** page, select **Next**.
1. On the **Summary** page, confirm your application settings and then complete the wizard.

You have finished creating the application. To find it, in the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Application Management**, and then choose **Applications**.

## Create a task sequence

The next step is to define a custom task sequence that installs the Azure Connected Machine Agent on a machine, then connects it to Azure Arc.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Operating Systems**, and then select the **Task Sequences** node.
1. On the **Home** tab of the ribbon, in the **Create** group, select **Create Task Sequence**. This will launch the Create Task Sequence Wizard.
1. On the **Create a New Task Sequence** page, select **Create a new custom task sequence**.
1. On the **Task Sequence Information** page, specify a name for the task sequence and optionally a description of the task sequence.

   :::image type="content" source="media/onboard-configuration-manager-custom-task/configuration-manager-create-task-sequence.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create Task Sequence Wizard in Configuration Manager.":::

After you complete the Create Task Sequence Wizard, Configuration Manager adds the custom task sequence to the **Task Sequences** node. You can now edit this task sequence to add steps to it.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Operating Systems**, and then select the **Task Sequences** node.
1. In the **Task Sequence** list, select the task sequence that you want to edit.
1. Define **Install Application** as the first task in the task sequence.
   1. On the **Home** tab of the ribbon, in the**Task Sequence** group, select **Edit**. Then, select **Add**, select **Software**, and select **Install Application**.
   1. Set the name to `Install Connected Machine Agent`.
   1. Select the Azure Connected Machine Agent.
      :::image type="content" source="media/onboard-configuration-manager-custom-task/configuration-manager-edit-task-sequence.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a task sequence being edited in Configuration Manager.":::
1. Define **Run PowerShell Script** as the second task in the task sequence.
   1. Select **Add**, select **General**, and select **Run PowerShell Script**.
   1. Set the name to `Connect to Azure Arc`.
   1. Select **Enter a PowerShell script**.
   1. Select **Add Script**, and then edit the script to connect to Arc as shown below. Note that this template script has placeholder values for the service principal, tenant, subscription, resource group, and location, which you should update to the appropriate values.

   ```azurepowershell
   & "$env:ProgramW6432\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\azcmagent.exe" connect --service-principal-id <serviceprincipalAppID> --service-principal-secret <serviceprincipalPassword> --tenant-id <tenantID> --subscription-id <subscriptionID> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --location <resourceLocation>
   ```

   :::image type="content" source="media/onboard-configuration-manager-custom-task/configuration-manager-connect-to-azure-arc.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a task sequence being edited to run a PowerShell script.":::
1. Set **PowerShell execution policy** to **Bypass** (if not already set by default). 
1. Select **OK** to save the changes to your custom task sequence.

## Deploy the custom task sequence and verify connection to Azure Arc

Follow the steps outlined in Deploy a task sequence to deploy the task sequence to the target collection of devices. Choose the following parameter settings.

- Under **Deployment Settings**, set **Purpose** as **Required** so that Configuration Manager automatically runs the task sequence according to the configured schedule. If **Purpose** is set to **Available** instead, the task sequence will need to be installed on demand from Software Center.
- Under **Scheduling**, set **Rerun Behavior** to **Rerun if failed previous attempt**.

## Verify successful connection to Azure Arc

To verify that the machines have been successfully connected to Azure Arc, verify that they are visible in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/hybridmachineportal).

## Next steps

- Review the [Planning and deployment guide](plan-at-scale-deployment.md) to plan for deploying Azure Arc-enabled servers at any scale and implement centralized management and monitoring.
- Review connection troubleshooting information in the [Troubleshoot Connected Machine agent guide](troubleshoot-agent-onboard.md).
- Learn how to manage your machine using [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) for such things as VM [guest configuration](/azure/governance/machine-configuration/overview), verifying that the machine is reporting to the expected Log Analytics workspace, enabling monitoring with [VM insights](/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-enable-policy), and much more.
