# Customer intent: "As a cloud administrator, I want to onboard multiple machines to Azure Arc using Ansible playbooks, so that I can efficiently manage and monitor my hybrid infrastructure at scale."

# Connect machines at scale using Ansible playbooks

You can onboard Ansible-managed nodes to Azure Arc-enabled servers at scale using Ansible playbooks. To do so, download, modify, and then run the appropriate playbook.

Before you get started, be sure to review the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) and verify that your subscription and resources meet the requirements. For information about supported regions and other related considerations, see [supported Azure regions](overview.md#supported-regions). Also review our [at-scale planning guide](plan-at-scale-deployment.md) to understand the design and deployment criteria, as well as our management and monitoring recommendations.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

## Generate a service principal and collect Azure details

Before you can run the script to connect your machines, you'll need to:

1. Follow the steps to [create a service principal for onboarding at scale](onboard-service-principal.md#create-a-service-principal-for-onboarding-at-scale).

    * Assign the Azure Connected Machine Onboarding role to your service principal and limit the scope of the role to the target Azure subscription or resource group.
    * Make a note of the Service Principal Secret and Service Principal Client ID; you'll need these values later.

1. Collect details on the Tenant ID, Subscription ID, Resource Group, and Region where the Azure Arc-enabled resource will onboard.

## Download the Ansible playbook

If you're onboarding machines to Azure Arc-enabled servers, copy the following Ansible playbook template and save the playbook as `arc-server-onboard-playbook.yml`.

```yaml
---
- name: Onboard Linux and Windows Servers to Azure Arc-enabled servers with public endpoint connectivity
  hosts: all
  # vars:
  #   azure:
  #     service_principal_id: 'INSERT-SERVICE-PRINCIPAL-CLIENT-ID'
  #     service_principal_secret: 'INSERT-SERVICE-PRINCIPAL-SECRET'
  #     resource_group: 'INSERT-RESOURCE-GROUP'
  #     tenant_id: 'INSERT-TENANT-ID'
  #     subscription_id: 'INSERT-SUBSCRIPTION-ID'
  #     location: 'INSERT-LOCATION'

    when: (ansible_os_family == 'Windows') and (azcmagent_win_connected.rc is defined and azcmagent_win_connected.rc != 0)
```

## Modify the Ansible playbook

After downloading the Ansible playbook, complete the following steps:

1. Within the Ansible playbook, modify the variables under the **vars section** with the service principal and Azure details collected earlier:

    * Service Principal ID
    * Service Principal Secret
    * Resource Group
    * Tenant ID
    * Subscription ID
    * Region

1. Enter the correct hosts field capturing the target servers for onboarding to Azure Arc. You can employ [Ansible patterns](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_patterns.html#common-patterns) to selectively target which hybrid machines to onboard.

1. This template passes the service principal secret as a variable in the Ansible playbook. Note that [Ansible vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) can be used to encrypt this secret and the variables can be passed through a configuration file.

## Run the Ansible playbook

From the Ansible control node, run the Ansible playbook by invoking the `ansible-playbook` command:

```
ansible-playbook arc-server-onboard-playbook.yml
```

After the playbook runs, **PLAY RECAP** indicates all tasks completed successfully and surfaces any nodes where tasks failed.

## Verify the connection with Azure Arc

After installing the agent and configuring it to connect to Azure Arc-enabled servers, go to the Azure portal to verify that the servers in your target hosts have successfully connected. View your machines in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/hybridmachineportal).

## Next steps

- Review the [Planning and deployment guide](plan-at-scale-deployment.md) to plan for deploying Azure Arc-enabled servers at any scale and implement centralized management and monitoring.
- Review connection troubleshooting information in the [Troubleshoot Connected Machine agent guide](troubleshoot-agent-onboard.md).
- Learn how to manage your machine using [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) for such things as VM [guest configuration](/azure/governance/machine-configuration/overview), verifying that the machine is reporting to the expected Log Analytics workspace, enabling monitoring with [VM insights](/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-enable-policy), and much more.
