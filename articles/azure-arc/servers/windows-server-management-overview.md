## Billing

Upon attestation, customers receive access to the following at no additional cost beyond networking, storage, and log ingestion:

- Azure Update Manager
- Azure Change Tracking and Inventory
- Azure Machine Configuration
- Windows Admin Center in Azure for Arc
- Remote Support
- Network HUD
- Best Practices Assessment
- Azure Site Recovery Configuration

Azure Change Tracking and Inventory and Best Practices Assessment require a Log Analytics workspace that may incur data ingestion costs. While the configuration of Azure Site Recovery is included as a benefit, customers incur costs for the Azure Site Recovery service itself, including for any storage, compute, and networking associated with the service. 

Customers need to explicitly attest for their Azure Arc-enabled servers or enroll in Windows Server pay-as-you-go to be exempt from billing for these services. Eligibility isn't inferred directly from the enablement to Azure Arc. Eligibility is not inferred from licensing status for the Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server instances that may be connected to an Azure Arc-enabled.   

Customer invoices reflect both the complementary benefits included and the enrollment in these benefits through attestation or through Windows Server pay-as-you-go.  

Customers that aren't attesting or enrolled through Windows Server pay-as-you-go can purchase Azure Update Manager, Azure Change Tracking and Inventory, and Azure Machine Configuration for their Azure Arc-enabled servers. The other services aren't available through Azure Arc for non-SA and non-pay-as-you-go customers.

## Requirements

- Agent Version: Connected Machine Agent version 1.47 or higher is required.  

- Operating Systems: The Azure Arc-enabled serverâ€™s Operating Systems must be Windows Server 2012 or higher with both Standard/Datacenter editions supported.  

- Networking: Connectivity methods supported include Public Endpoint, Proxy, Azure Arc Gateway, and Private Endpoint. No additional endpoints need to be allowed.  

- Licensing: The Azure Arc-enabled server must be officially licensed through a valid licensing channel. Unlicensed servers aren't eligible for these benefits. Azure Arc-enabled servers enrolled in Windows Server pay-as-you-go are automatically activated for these benefits.  

- Connectivity: The Azure Arc-enabled server must be *Connected* for enrollment. Disconnected and expired servers aren't eligible. Usage of the included benefits requires connectivity.   

- Regions: Activation is available in all regions where Azure Arc-enabled servers has regional availability except for US Gov Virginia, US Gov Arizona, China North 2, China North 3, and China East 2.

- Environments: Supported environments include Hyper-V, VMware, SCVMM, Stack HCI, AVS, and bare-metal where servers are connected to Azure Arc. 

- Modes: Customers can use Monitor mode and extension allowlists or blocklists with their attestation to Azure Arc-enabled servers.

```powershell
$subscriptionId    = '' #Your subscription id 
$resourceGroupName = '' # your Resource Group 
$machineName       = '' # Arc resource name 
$location = "" # The region where the test machine is arc enabled. 

$account       = Connect-AzAccount 
$context       = Set-azContext -Subscription $subscriptionId 
$profile       = [Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Common.Authentication.Abstractions.AzureRmProfileProvider]::Instance.Profile 
$profileClient = [Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ResourceManager.Common.rmProfileClient]::new( $profile ) 
$token         = $profileClient.AcquireAccessToken($context.Subscription.TenantId) 
$header = @{ 
   'Content-Type'='application/json' 
   'Authorization'='Bearer ' + $token.AccessToken 
} 

$uri = [System.Uri]::new( "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/$machineName/licenseProfiles/default?api-version=2023-10-03-preview" ) 
$contentType = "application/json"  
$data = @{         
    location = $location; 
    properties = @{ 
        softwareAssurance = @{ 
            softwareAssuranceCustomer= $true; 
        }; 
    }; 
}; 
$json = $data | ConvertTo-Json; 
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Method PUT -Uri $uri.AbsoluteUri -ContentType $contentType -Headers $header -Body $json; 
$response.properties
