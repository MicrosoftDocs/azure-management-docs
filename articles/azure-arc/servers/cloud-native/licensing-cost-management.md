# Cloud-native licensing and cost management

In a traditional setup, licensing for servers can be complex, especially in hybrid environments. Cloud-native licensing models for your Azure Arc-enabled servers provide flexibility and reduce overhead, so you can avoid buying perpetual licenses and doing annual true-ups for compliance. This shift lets you handle your Windows and SQL Server licensing like a cloud service: you only pay for what you use, when you use it, and you can manage it all centrally through Azure. For a system administrator, this means less time tracking license keys or entering activation codes, and more confidence that your servers are properly licensed and receiving critical updates.
