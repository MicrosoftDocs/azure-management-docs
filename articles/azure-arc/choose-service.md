# Choosing the right Azure Arc service for machines

Azure Arc offers different services based on your existing IT infrastructure and management needs. Before onboarding your resources to Azure Arc-enabled servers, you should investigate the different Azure Arc offerings to determine which best suits your requirements. Choosing the right Azure Arc service provides the best possible inventorying and management of your resources.

There are several different ways you can connect your existing Windows and Linux machines to Azure Arc:

- Azure Arc-enabled servers
- Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere
- Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)
- Azure Local

Each of these services extends the Azure control plane to your existing infrastructure and enables the use of [Azure security, governance, and management capabilities using the Connected Machine agent](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview). Other services besides Azure Arc-enabled servers also use an [Azure Arc resource bridge](/azure/azure-arc/resource-bridge/overview), a part of the core Azure Arc platform that provides self-servicing and additional management capabilities.

The following table provides a quick way to see the major capabilities of the Azure Arc services that connect your existing Windows and Linux machines to Azure Arc.

### General recommendations

General recommendations about the right service to use are as follows:

|If your machine is a... |...connect to Azure with... |
|---------|---------|
|VMware VM (not running on AVS) |[Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere](vmware-vsphere/overview.md) (to get the complete set of Azure capabilities). <br> [Azure Arc-enabled servers](servers/overview.md) (to use Azure services only). |
|Azure VMware Solution (AVS) VM |[Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere for Azure VMware Solution](/azure/azure-vmware/deploy-arc-for-azure-vmware-solution?tabs=windows) |
|VM managed by System Center Virtual Machine Manager |[Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM](system-center-virtual-machine-manager/overview.md) (to get the complete set of Azure capabilities). <br> [Azure Arc-enabled servers](servers/overview.md) (to use Azure services only). |
|Azure Local machine, including the ones managed by SCVMM |[Azure Local](/azure/azure-local/overview) |
|Physical server |[Azure Arc-enabled servers](servers/overview.md) |
|VM on another hypervisor |[Azure Arc-enabled servers](servers/overview.md) |
|VM on another cloud provider |[Azure Arc-enabled servers](servers/overview.md) |

If you're unsure about which of these services to use, you can start with Azure Arc-enabled servers and add a resource bridge for additional management capabilities later. Azure Arc-enabled servers allows you to connect servers containing all of the types of VMs supported by the other services and provides a wide range of capabilities such as Azure Policy and monitoring, while adding resource bridge can extend additional capabilities.

Region availability also varies between Azure Arc services, so you may need to use Azure Arc-enabled servers if a more specialized version of Azure Arc is unavailable in your preferred region. See [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=azure-arc&regions=all&rar=true) to learn more about region availability for Azure Arc services.

Where your machine runs determines the best Azure Arc service to use. Organizations with diverse infrastructure may end up using more than one Azure Arc service; this is alright. The core set of features remains the same no matter which Azure Arc service you use.

## Azure Arc-enabled servers

[Azure Arc-enabled servers](servers/overview.md) lets you manage Windows and Linux physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure, on your corporate network, or other cloud provider. When connecting your machine to Azure Arc-enabled servers, you can perform various operational functions similar to native Azure virtual machines.

### Capabilities

- Govern: Assign Azure Automanage machine configurations to audit settings within the machine. Utilize Azure Policy pricing guide for cost understanding.

- Protect: Safeguard non-Azure servers with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, integrated through Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This includes threat detection, vulnerability management, and proactive security monitoring. Utilize Microsoft Sentinel for collecting security events and correlating them with other data sources.
