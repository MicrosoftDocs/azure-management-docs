# Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes validation

The Azure Arc team works with key industry Kubernetes offering providers to validate Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes with their Kubernetes distributions. Future major and minor versions of Kubernetes distributions released by these providers will be validated for compatibility with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes works with any Kubernetes clusters that are certified by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), even if they are not listed on this page.

## Validated distributions

The following Microsoft-provided Kubernetes distributions and infrastructure providers successfully passed the conformance tests for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes:

## Scenarios validated

The conformance tests run as part of the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes validation cover the following scenarios:

1. Connect Kubernetes clusters to Azure Arc:
    * Deploy Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes agent Helm chart on cluster.
    * Agents send cluster metadata to Azure.

2. Configuration:
    * Create configuration on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes resource.
    * [Flux](https://docs.fluxcd.io/), needed for setting up [GitOps workflow](tutorial-use-gitops-flux2.md), is deployed on the cluster.
    * Flux pulls manifests and Helm charts from demo Git repo and deploys to cluster.

* Learn about the [Azure Arc agents](conceptual-agent-overview.md) deployed on Kubernetes clusters when connecting them to Azure Arc.
