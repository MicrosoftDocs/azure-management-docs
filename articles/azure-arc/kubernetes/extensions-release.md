# Available extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters

[Cluster extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](conceptual-extensions.md) provide an Azure Resource Manager-based experience to install and manage lifecycles for different Azure capabilities in your cluster. You can [deploy extensions to your clusters](extensions.md) to support different scenarios and to improve cluster management.

The following extensions are currently available to use with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. With one exception, all the extensions that are described in this article are [cluster-scoped](conceptual-extensions.md#extension-scope). Azure API Management on Azure Arc is namespace-scoped.

## Container insights in Azure Monitor

- **Supported distributions**: All Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)-certified Kubernetes clusters.

The Container insights feature in Azure Monitor gives you a view into the performance of workloads that are deployed on your Kubernetes cluster. Use this extension to collect memory and CPU utilization metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers.

For more information, see [Container insights for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-arc-enabled-clusters?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json&bc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/breadcrumb/toc.json).

## Azure Policy

Azure Policy extends [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper), an admission controller webhook for [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA). Use Gatekeeper with OPA to consistently apply centralized, at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters.

For more information, see [Understand Azure Policy for Kubernetes clusters](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json&bc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/breadcrumb/toc.json).

## Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider

- **Supported distributions**: AKS on Azure Local, AKS enabled by Azure Arc, Cluster API Azure, Google Kubernetes Engine, Canonical Kubernetes Distribution, OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.

Use the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver to integrate an instance of Azure Key Vault as a secrets store with a Kubernetes cluster via a CSI volume. For Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, you can install the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension to fetch secrets.

For more information, see [Use the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension to fetch secrets into Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](tutorial-akv-secrets-provider.md).

## Azure Key Vault Secret Store

- **Supported distributions**: Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters running Kubernetes 1.27 or later, including: AKS on Azure Local, AKS Edge Essentials, OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution, and VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.

The Azure Key Vault Secret Store extension for Kubernetes (Secret Store) automatically syncs secrets from an instance of Azure Key Vault to a Kubernetes cluster for offline access. You can use Azure Key Vault to store, maintain, and rotate your secrets, even when you run your Kubernetes cluster in a semi-disconnected state.

We recommend the Secret Store extension for clusters at the edge where internet connectivity cannot be guaranteed, or if you need secrets synced to the Kubernetes secret store. For clusters in Azure cloud that do not require local secret storage, we recommend that you use the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension instead.

For more information, see [Use the Secret Store extension to fetch secrets for offline access in Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](secret-store-extension.md).

## Microsoft Defender for Containers

- **Supported distributions**: AKS enabled by Azure Arc, Cluster API Azure, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift (version 4.6 or later), Google Kubernetes Engine Standard, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, Rancher Kubernetes Engine, and Canonical Kubernetes Distribution.

Microsoft Defender for Containers is the cloud-native solution that is used to secure your containers so you can improve, monitor, and maintain the security of your clusters, containers, and their applications. Microsoft Defender for Containers gathers information related to security, such as audit log data, from the Kubernetes cluster. Then, it provides recommendations and threat alerts based on the gathered data.

For more information, see [Enable Microsoft Defender for Containers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-kubernetes-azure-arc?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json&bc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/breadcrumb/toc.json).

> When a new version of the `microsoft.flux` extension is released, it might take several days for the new version to become available in all regions.

### Deprecation and removal notice: Upcoming changes to `microsoft.flux` extension

Several upstream Flux APIs that have been retired by the Flux project will be removed in an upcoming release of the `microsoft.flux` extension. These changes align with the Flux community's efforts to streamline and modernize the API surface.

The following Flux APIs are being deprecated and will be removed:

- Deprecated APIs in group `source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1`
- Deprecated APIs in group `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1`
- Deprecated APIs in group `helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1`
- Deprecated APIs in group `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1`
- Deprecated APIs in group `image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1`

For a complete list of deprecated APIs and their replacements, see the PRs linked in <https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/issues/5474>.

**Required action:** To ensure continued compatibility and avoid disruptions, update your sources to remove references to deprecated APIs. Use the supported API versions for all impacted resources. We strongly recommend completing these steps before October 2025 to avoid deployment failures or resource reconciliation issues.

Migrate all your resources to the Flux stable APIs in your sources (Git repositories, OCI repositories, buckets, blob storage) by replacing the API version in the manifests:

-	`Kustomization` to `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1`
-	`HelmRelease` to `helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2`
-	`Bucket` to `source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1`
-	`GitRepository` to `source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1`
-	`HelmChart` to `source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1`
-	`HelmRepository` to `source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1`
-	`OCIRepository` to `source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1`
-	`Receiver` to `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1`
-	`Alert` to `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta3`
-	`Provider` to `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta3`
-	`ImageRepository` to `image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2`
-	`ImagePolicy` to `image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2`
-	`ImageUpdateAutomation` to `image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2`

Note that the `ImageUpdateAutomation` commit template should use the fields `.Changed.FileChanges`, `.Changed.Objects` and `.Changed.Changes` instead of the deprecated `.Updated` and `.Changed.ImageResult` fields.

Once the manifests are updated in the sources, Flux will reconcile the new API versions.
