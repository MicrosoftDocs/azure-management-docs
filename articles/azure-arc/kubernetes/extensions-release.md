# Available extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters

[Cluster extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](conceptual-extensions.md) provide an Azure Resource Manager-based experience to install and manage lifecycles for different Azure capabilities in your cluster. You can [deploy extensions to your clusters](extensions.md) to support different scenarios and to improve cluster management.

The following extensions are currently available to use with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. With one exception, all the extensions that are described in this article are [cluster-scoped](conceptual-extensions.md#extension-scope). Azure API Management on Azure Arc is namespace-scoped.

## Container insights in Azure Monitor

- **Supported distributions**: All Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)-certified Kubernetes clusters.

The Container insights feature in Azure Monitor gives you a view into the performance of workloads that are deployed on your Kubernetes cluster. Use this extension to collect memory and CPU utilization metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers.

For more information, see [Container insights for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-arc-enabled-clusters?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json&bc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/breadcrumb/toc.json).

## Azure Policy

Azure Policy extends [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper), an admission controller webhook for [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA). Use Gatekeeper with OPA to consistently apply centralized, at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters.

For more information, see [Understand Azure Policy for Kubernetes clusters](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json&bc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/breadcrumb/toc.json).

## Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider

- **Supported distributions**: AKS on Azure Local, AKS enabled by Azure Arc, Cluster API Azure, Google Kubernetes Engine, Canonical Kubernetes Distribution, OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.

Use the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver to integrate an instance of Azure Key Vault as a secrets store with a Kubernetes cluster via a CSI volume. For Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, you can install the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension to fetch secrets.

For more information, see [Use the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension to fetch secrets into Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](tutorial-akv-secrets-provider.md).

## Secret Store

- **Supported distributions**: All CNCF-certified Kubernetes clusters that are connected to Azure Arc and running Kubernetes 1.27 or later.

The Azure Key Vault Secret Store extension for Kubernetes (Secret Store) automatically syncs secrets from an instance of Azure Key Vault to a Kubernetes cluster for offline access. You can use Azure Key Vault to store, maintain, and rotate your secrets, even when you run your Kubernetes cluster in a semi-disconnected state.

We recommend the Secret Store extension for scenarios that require offline access, or if you need secrets synced to the Kubernetes secret store. If you don't need to use these features, we recommend that you instead use the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension.

For more information, see [Use the Secret Store extension to fetch secrets for offline access in Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](secret-store-extension.md).

>
> The [HelmChart](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmcharts/) API will be promoted from `v1beta2` to `v1` (GA). The `v1` API is backward compatible with `v1beta2`, with the exception of the `.spec.valuesFile` field, which is replaced by `.spec.valuesFiles`.
>
> The new fields are already available in the current version of the APIs. Use the new fields instead of the fields that will be removed in the upcoming release.
>
> The Kustomize package will be updated to v5.4.0. The version contains the following breaking changes:
>
> - [Kustomization build fails when the resources key is missing](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/5337)
> - [Components are now applied after generators and before transformers](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/pull/5170) in [v5.1.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv5.1.0)
> - [Null YAML values are replaced by "null"](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/pull/5519) in [v5.4.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv5.4.0)
