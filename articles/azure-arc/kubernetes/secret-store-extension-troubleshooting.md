# Troubleshooting
The SSE is a Kubernetes deployment that contains a pod with two containers: the controller, which manages storage of secrets in the cluster, and the provider, which accesses secrets from Azure Key Vault (AKV). SSE is configured via `SecretSync` and `SecretProviderClass` resources. In addition to configuration parameters, `SecretSync` classes are updated by the SSE controller with the status of the sync operation, including error messages where appropriate.

## Checking a SecretSync status

The most common issues with the SSE can be investigated by checking the status of the related `SecretSync` object. Use a `kubectl describe ...` command to view the status of a sync object. In addition to the overall configuration, the output includes the secret creation timestamp, the versions of the secret, and detailed status messages for each synchronization event. This output can be used to diagnose connection or configuration errors and to observe when the secret value changes.

```bash
kubectl describe secretsync <secret-sync-name> -n ${KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE}
```

## SecretSync status reasons

The following table lists common status reasons, their meanings, and potential troubleshooting steps to resolve errors.

| SecretSync Status Reason     | Details      | Steps to fix/investigate further    |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| `UpdateNoValueChangeSucceeded` | The secret in Kubernetes is fully up-to-date to the AKV version. No change was needed during the latest check. | n/a |
| `UpdateValueChangeOrForceUpdateSucceeded` | The whole secret in Kubernetes was successfully updated to the AKV version during the latest check. | n/a |
| `PartialSync` | Some items in the secret could not be updated. | Investigate further by looking at the `status.conditions.message` field of the `SecretSync` object. This field contains a stringified json summary of the success or failure for each item in the secret. |
| `ProviderError` | Secret creation failed due to some issue with the provider (connection to Azure Key Vault). This failure could be due to internet connectivity, insufficient permissions for the identity syncing secrets, misconfiguration of the `SecretProviderClass`, or other issues. | Investigate first as with `PartialSync`, next look at the logs of the provider using the following commands: <br>```kubectl get pods -n azure-secret-store``` <br>```kubectl logs <secret-sync-controller-pod-name> -n azure-secret-store --container='provider-azure-installer'``` |
| `InvalidClusterSecretLabelError`<br>`InvalidClusterSecretAnnotationError` | A secret already exists with this name that SSE does not manage. | Remove the secret to allow the SSE to recreate the secret: ```kubectl delete secret <secret-name>``` <br>To force the SSE to recreate the secret faster than the configured rotation poll interval, delete the `SecretSync` object (```kubectl delete secretsync <secret-name>```) and reapply the secret sync class (```kubectl apply -f <path_to_secret_sync>```). |
| `UserInputValidationFailed` | Secret update failed because the secret sync class was configured incorrectly (such as an invalid secret type). | Review the secret sync class definition and correct any errors. Then, delete the `SecretSync` object (```kubectl delete secretsync <secret-name>```), delete the secret sync class (```kubectl delete -f <path_to_secret_sync>```), and reapply the secret sync class (```kubectl apply -f <path_to_secret_sync>```). |
| `ControllerSpcError` | Secret update failed because the SSE failed to get the provider class or the provider class is misconfigured. | Review the provider class and correct any errors. Then, delete the `SecretSync` object (```kubectl delete secretsync <secret-name>```), delete the provider class (```kubectl delete -f <path_to_provider>```), and reapply the provider class (```kubectl apply -f <path_to_provider>```). |
| `ControllerInternalError`<br>`ValidatingAdmissionPolicyCheckFailed`<br>`ControllerSyncFailed`  | Secret update failed due to an internal error in the SSE. | Check the SSE logs or the events for more information: <br>```kubectl get pods -n azure-secret-store``` <br>```kubectl logs <secret-sync-controller-pod-name> -n azure-secret-store --container='manager'``` |
| `UnknownError`| Secret update failed during patching the Kubernetes secret value. This failure might occur if someone other than the SSE modifies the secret, or if there were issues during an update of the SSE. | Try deleting the secret and `SecretSync` object, then let the SSE recreate the secret by reapplying the `SecretSync` object: <br>```kubectl delete secret <secret-name>``` <br>```kubectl delete secretsync <secret-name>```  <br>```kubectl apply -f <path_to_secret_sync>```<br>If this does not help, follow the steps to inspect the logs as with a  `ControllerInternalError`. |

## Network access issues

If you see a ```ProviderError``` status reason with a message indicating a timeout or inability to reach your key vault endpoint (```<vault_name>.vault.azure.net```), there is a likely network access issue to resolve. Possible network access issues include:

### Azure Key Vault firewall configuration
By default Azure Key Vault has a permissive firewall configuration and can be accessed via the public internet, but it is good practice to limit network access to Azure Key Vault. Double check that your key vault firewall configuration permits access for your cluster. See [Network security for Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/network-security)

#### Azure Arc Gateway (preview)
Azure Arc gateway (preview) does not provide network connectivity to Azure Key Vault. You must independently allow network access to ```<vault_name>.vault.azure.net``` so that SSE can synchronize secrets. See related [Arc gateway](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/arc-gateway-simplify-networking) and [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/access-behind-firewall) documentation.


### Azure Private Link
If using Azure Arc Private Link: Ensure your DNS and network allow the Arc-connected cluster to reach the Key Vaultâ€™s private endpoint. Verify that DNS resolution for the vault name returns the private IP and that the private link IP is routed correctly from your cluster. See [Diagnose private link configuration issues on Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/private-link-diagnostics).

## Slow or missing updates

Secret Store Extension waits a set interval between checking Azure Key Vault for updates. When a secret is updated in AKV, it is only downloaded to the cluster when the interval expires and SSE checks again. The default interval is one hour (3,600 seconds), this is set via the configuration setting `rotationPollIntervalInSeconds`. See [configuration reference](secret-store-extension-reference.md#arc-extension-configuration-settings).

To force the SSE to update a secret immediately, update any part of the `spec` field within the `SecretSync` resource. A special field `forceSynchronization` can be set within a `spec` that does not have any effect on the configuration; SSE updates the secret immediately if the value of `forceSynchronization` is modified. See [SecretSync reference](secret-store-extension-reference.md#secretsync-resources)) for an example.
