# Data exchanged between Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster and Azure

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes scenarios involve exchange of desired state configurations, metadata, and other scenario specific operational data between the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster environment and Azure service. For all types of data, the [Azure Arc agents](conceptual-agent-overview.md) initiate outbound communication to Azure services, so they only require only egress access to endpoints listed in the [network prerequisites](network-requirements.md). Enabling inbound ports on firewall isn't required for the Azure Arc agents.

The following table describes the data exchanged between these environments for different scenarios.

## Data exchange between cluster and Azure

| Scenario | Metadata | Communication mode |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Cluster metadata | Kubernetes cluster version | Agent pushes to Azure |
| Cluster metadata | Number of nodes in the cluster | Agent pushes to Azure |
| Cluster metadata | Agent version | Agent pushes to Azure |
| Cluster metadata | Kubernetes distribution type | Azure CLI pushes to Azure |
| Cluster metadata | Infrastructure type (AWS/GCP/vSphere/...) | Azure CLI pushes to Azure |
| Cluster metadata | vCPU count of nodes in the cluster | Agent pushes to Azure |
| Resource Health | Agent heartbeat | Agent pushes to Azure |
| Diagnostics and supportability | Resource consumption (memory/CPU) by agents | Agent pushes to Azure |
| Diagnostics and supportability | Logs of all agent containers | Agent pushes to Azure |
| Agent upgrade | Agent upgrade availability | Agent pulls from Azure |
| Configuration (GitOps) | Desired state of configuration: Git repository URL, flux operator parameters, private key, known hosts content, HTTPS username, token, or password | Agent pulls from Azure |
| Configuration (GitOps) | Status of flux operator installation | Agent pushes to Azure |
| Extensions | Desired state of extension: extension type, configuration settings, protected configuration settings, release train, auto-upgrade settings | Agent pulls from Azure |
| Azure Policy | Azure Policy assignments that need Gatekeeper enforcement within cluster | Agent pulls from Azure |
| Azure Policy | Audit and compliance status of in-cluster policy enforcements | Agent pushes to Azure |
| Azure Monitor | Metrics and logs of customer workloads | Agent pushes to Log Analytics workspace resource in customer's tenant and subscription |
| Cluster Connect | Requests sent to cluster | Outbound session established with Arc service by clusterconnect-agent used to send requests to cluster |
| Custom Location | Metadata on namespace and ClusterRoleBinding/RoleBinding for authorization | Outbound session established with Arc service by clusterconnect-agent used to send requests to cluster |
| Resources on top of custom location | Desired specifications of databases or application instances | Outbound session established with Arc service by clusterconnect-agent used to send requests to cluster |
