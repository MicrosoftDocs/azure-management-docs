# Customer intent: As a developer using Edge RAG, I want to delete all data from the vector database, so that I can ensure a complete reset of the index and remove any unwanted data ingestions and evaluation data.

# Delete data in Edge RAG Preview, enabled by Azure Arc

Edge RAG supports only one index, which contains the embeddings for all the data ingested and any evaluation data. You can't delete individual data ingestions or evaluations from the **Data** tab.

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](includes/preview-notice.md)]

## Prerequisites

To access to the developer portal, you must have both the "EdgeRAGDeveloper" and "EdgeRAGEndUser" roles in Microsoft Entra.

## Delete data from the vector database

If you want to delete the data in your index, including all the individual data ingestions and any evaluation data, complete the following the steps:

1. Go to the developer portal using the domain name provided at deployment and app registration. For example, `https://arcrag.contoso.com`.
1. Sign in with developer credentials that have both "EdgeRAGDeveloper" and "EdgeRAGEndUser" roles assigned.
1. Go to **Data** tab.
1. Select on the **Delete** button on the toolbar
1. Confirm if you want to delete all the data from the vector index.

This step clears all the data in the vector database and empties the data ingestions history table.

If there's a data ingestion job running or pending, you see an error message and aren't able to delete the data in the index. Let those processes complete before trying again.
