# Quickstart: Connect your System Center Virtual Machine Manager management server to Azure Arc

Before you can start using the Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM features, you need to connect your VMM management server to Azure Arc.

This Quickstart shows you how to connect your SCVMM management server to Azure Arc using a helper script. The script deploys a lightweight Azure Arc appliance (called Azure Arc resource bridge) as a virtual machine running in your VMM environment and installs an SCVMM cluster extension on it to provide a continuous connection between your VMM management server and Azure Arc.

## Prerequisites

>[!Note]
> - If VMM server is running on Windows Server 2016 machine, ensure that [Open SSH package](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases) and tar are installed. To install tar, you can copy tar.exe and archiveint.dll from any Windows 11 or Windows Server 2019/2022 machine to *C:\Windows\System32* path on your VMM server machine.
> - Azure Arc resource bridge deployment using private link (private endpoint) is currently not supported.

| **Requirement** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Azure** | An Azure subscription  <br/><br/> A resource group in the above subscription where you have the *Owner/Contributor* role. |
| **SCVMM** | You need an SCVMM management server running version 2019 or later.<br/><br/> A private cloud or a host group with a minimum free capacity of 32 GB of RAM, 4 vCPUs with 100 GB of free disk space. The supported storage configurations are hybrid storage (flash and HDD) and all-flash storage (SSDs or NVMe). <br/><br/> A VM network with internet access, directly or through proxy. Appliance VM will be deployed using this VM network.<br/><br/> Only Static IP allocation is supported; Dynamic IP allocation using DHCP isn't supported. Static IP allocation can be performed by one of the following approaches:<br><br> 1. **VMM IP Pool**: Follow [these steps](/system-center/vmm/network-pool?view=sc-vmm-2022&preserve-view=true) to create a VMM Static IP Pool and ensure that the Static IP Pool has at least three IP addresses. If your SCVMM server is behind a firewall, all the IPs in this IP Pool and the Control Plane IP should be allowed to communicate through WinRM ports. The default WinRM ports are 5985 and 5986.  The onboarding experience directs you to this approach by default if the VMM Cloud or Host Group chosen as the Azure Arc resource bridge target has IP Pool(s) configured. <br> <br> 2. **Custom IP range**: Ensure that your VM network has three continuous free IP addresses. If your SCVMM server is behind a firewall, all the IPs in this IP range and the Control Plane IP should be allowed to communicate through WinRM ports. The default WinRM ports are 5985 and 5986. If the VM network is configured with a VLAN, the VLAN ID is required as an input.  In the Logical network associated with the VM Network, ensure that *Logical Network Definition (LND)* or *Network Site* is configured with the corresponding VLAN ID. Azure Arc Resource Bridge requires internal and external DNS resolution to the required sites and the on-premises management machine for the Static gateway IP and the IP address(es) of your DNS server(s) are needed.  The onboarding experience directs you to this approach by default if the VMM Cloud or Host Group chosen as the Azure Arc resource bridge target has no IP Pool(s) configured.<br><br>The inbound and outbound connectivity URL listed [here](/azure/azure-arc/system-center-virtual-machine-manager/support-matrix-for-system-center-virtual-machine-manager#resource-bridge-networking-requirements) are required to be allowlisted.<br><br> A library share with write permission for the SCVMM admin account through which Resource Bridge deployment is going to be performed.|
| **SCVMM accounts** | An SCVMM admin account that can perform all administrative actions on all objects that VMM manages. <br/><br/> The user should be part of local administrator account in the SCVMM server. If the SCVMM server is installed in a High Availability configuration, the user should be a part of the local administrator accounts in all the SCVMM cluster nodes. <br/><br/>This will be used for the ongoing operation of Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM and the deployment of the Arc Resource bridge VM. |
| **Workstation** | The workstation will be used to run the helper script. Ensure you have [64-bit Azure CLI installed](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) on the workstation.<br/><br/> A Windows/Linux machine that can access both your SCVMM management server and internet, directly or through proxy.<br/><br/> The helper script can be run directly from the VMM server machine as well.<br/><br/> To avoid network latency issues, we recommend executing the helper script directly in the VMM server machine.<br/><br/> Note that when you execute the script from a Linux machine, the deployment takes a bit longer and you might experience performance issues. |

## Prepare SCVMM management server

- Ensure you have a host group or a SCVMM private cloud with a reservation of at least 32 GB of RAM, 4 vCPUs and at least 100 GB of disk space.
- Ensure that SCVMM administrator account has the appropriate permissions.

|**CertificateFilePath** | For SSL based proxies, provide the path to the certificate. |

Once the command execution is completed, your setup is complete, and you can try out the capabilities of Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The resource bridge must continue to be in *online* status for Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM to perform virtual machine CRUD and powercycle operations. To maintain your resource bridge in a *healthy* state, we recommend you to follow the best practices listed [here](https://aka.ms/scvmmarbbestpractices). 

## Recover from failed deployments

If the Azure Arc resource bridge deployment fails, see the Troubleshooting section for debugging steps.

To clean up the installation and retry the deployment, use the following commands.

# [Retry command - Windows](#tab/win)

Run the command with ```-Force``` to clean up and onboard again.

```powershell-interactive
 ./resource-bridge-onboarding-script.ps1 -Force -Subscription <Subscription> -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroup> -AzLocation <AzLocation> -ApplianceName <ApplianceName> -CustomLocationName <CustomLocationName> -VMMservername <VMMservername>
```

>[!Note]
>You can find the values for *Subscription*, *ResourceGroup*, *Azlocation*, *ApplianceName*, *CustomLocationName*, and *VMMservername* parameters from the onboarding script.
 
# [Retry command - Linux](#tab/lin)

Run the command with ```--force``` to clean up and onboard again.
