# Enable VM CRUD and power cycle operational ability in an SCVMM managed Arc-enabled server machine

This article describes how to enable VM CRUD and power cycle operational ability on an SCVMM managed VM that has Arc agents installed via the Azure Arc-enabled Servers route.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>- This article is applicable only if you've installed Arc agents directly in SCVMM managed virtual machines **before** onboarding to Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM by deploying Azure Arc resource bridge. 
>- If you installed Arc agents directly in SCVMM managed virtual machines, **after** onboarding to Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM by deploying Azure Arc resource bridge, refer to this [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureArcSCVMMTSG/blob/main/1_Unifed%20resource%20model.md) to link the machines to Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM and get the full range of Azure Arc's VM management capabilities. 

## Prerequisites

Before you enable VM CRUD and power cycle management on an SCVMM managed VM, ensure you meet these prerequisites:

- An Azure subscription and resource group where you have *Arc SCVMM VM Administrator* role. 
- Your SCVMM management server instance must be [onboarded](quickstart-connect-system-center-virtual-machine-manager-to-arc.md) to Azure Arc. The onboarded SCVMM management server must be in a *Connected* state and its associated Azure Arc resource bridge must be in a *Running* state. 

## Link Azure Arc-enabled server machines to Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM 

To enable the virtual machine lifecycle and power cycle management ability and self-service access, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to the **Virtual machines** inventory page of your SCVMM management servers. The virtual machines that have Arc agent installed via the Arc-enabled Servers route will have **Link to SCVMM** status under virtual hardware management.

1. Select **Link to SCVMM** to view the pane with the list of all the machines under SCVMM management server with Arc agent installed but not linked to the SCVMM management server in Azure Arc.

1. Choose all the machines that need to be enabled in Azure, and select **Link** to link the machines to the Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM management server.

1. After you perform the **Link to SCVMM** operation, the **virtual hardware management** status reflects as **Enabled** for all the VMs, and you can perform lifecycle and power cycle operations on them.
