# What's new with Azure Arc resource bridge

Azure Arc resource bridge should be updated on an ongoing basis. To stay up to date with the most recent developments, this article provides you with information about recent releases of the Azure CLI extension, `az arcappliance`, that is used to deploy Arc resource bridge.  

We generally recommend using the most recent versions. The [version support policy](overview.md#supported-versions) for the appliance generally covers the most recent version and the three previous versions (n-3). Even if a version is within the version support policy (n-3), the appliance should be upgraded at least once every six months to ensure the internal components and certificates are refreshed. You can check your appliance version and the version release date for an estimate on the last upgrade date and ensure an upgrade happens at least once every six months.Â When a patch version is released, the upgrade path might skip the minor version and directly upgrade to the patch version. In such cases, the supported versions (n-3) exclude the skipped minor version and include the patch version instead.

> [NOTE]
> This patch version of the Azure CLI extension `az arcappliance` doesn't change the appliance version. Therefore, `az arcappliance` CLI extension 1.4.1 and 1.4.0 both have the same appliance version, 1.4.0.
