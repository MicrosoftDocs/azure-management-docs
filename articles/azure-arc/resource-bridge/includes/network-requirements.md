# Customer intent: "As a network administrator, I want to configure outbound and inbound connectivity settings for the appliance VM and management machine, so that I can ensure smooth communication and functionality for the Arc resource bridge."
---

### Outbound connectivity requirements

The firewall and proxy URLs below must be allowlisted in order to enable communication from the management machine, Appliance VM, and Control Plane IP to the required Arc resource bridge URLs.
