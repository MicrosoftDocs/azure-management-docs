Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits, whether you're a developer just starting your cloud journey or a large organization deploying business-critical, strategic applications. Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal.

- If you already have an Azure Support Plan, [open a support request here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

- To sign up for a new Azure Support Plan, [compare support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/) and select the plan that works for you.

## Create a GitHub issue

Submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner/issues/new/choose) to ask a question, provide feedback, or submit a feature request. Create an [Azure support request](#create-an-azure-support-request) for any issues or bugs.

## Stay connected with Azure Linux

We're hosting public community calls for Azure Linux users to get together and discuss new features, provide feedback, and learn more about how others use Azure Linux. In each session, we will feature a new demo.

Azure Linux published a [feature roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/970/views/2) that contains features that are in development and available for GA and public preview. This feature roadmap will be reviewed in each community call. We welcome you to leave feedback or ask questions on feature items.

The schedule for the upcoming community calls is as follows:
