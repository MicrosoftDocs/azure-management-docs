> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [Retirement: Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).
