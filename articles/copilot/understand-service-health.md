# Understand service health events and status using Microsoft Copilot in Azure

You can ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure questions to get information from [Azure Service Health](/azure/service-health/overview) and [Azure Resource Health](/azure/service-health/resource-health-overview). This tool provides a quick way to find out if there are any service health events impacting your Azure subscriptions. You can also get more information about a known service health event, planned maintenance, and security or health advisories.

Copilot in Azure can be helpful for all Microsoft customers who use Service health and Resource health to assess their system health.

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to get service health information. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try other prompts about specific service health events.

- "Am I being impacted by any service health events?"
- "Is there any outage impacting me?"
- "Can you tell me more about tracking ID {0}?"
- "Is the event with tracking ID {0} still active?"
- "What is the status of the event with tracking ID {0}?"
- "What are the impacted resources from event {0}?"
- "Do I have any impacted resources from event {0}?"
- "Can you share health information of resource ``/subscriptions/testSub/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/testResource?`

## Examples

You can ask "**Is there any Azure outage ongoing?**" In this example, no outages or service health issues are found. If Copilot responds that there are service health issues impacting your account, you can ask further questions to get more information.

You can also ask about a specific service event to see whether it's resolved. If you know the tracking ID, you can ask "**Is incident {0} still active?**"

To find out about current or past planned maintenance events, use prompts like "**Any planned maintenance events?**" or "**How many planned maintenance events in the last 20 days?**"

You can also ask about current and past security advisories. For example, "**How many active security advisories?**" or "**How many security advisories in the last 50 days?**"

To check whether any Post Incident Reviews (PIRs) are available, ask "**Are there any PIRs?**"
