# Work smarter with your Azure Local instances using Azure Copilot

Azure Copilot can help you identify problems and get information about your [Azure Local](/azure/azure-local/overview) instances.

When you ask Azure Copilot for information about the state of your hybrid infrastructure, it automatically pulls context when possible, based on the current conversation or on the page you're viewing in the Azure portal. If the context of a query isn't clear, you'll be prompted to clarify what you're looking for.

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to work with your Azure Local instances. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to get different types of information.

- "Summarize my Azure Local instances"
- "Tell me more about the alerts"
- "Generate a summary of my Arc Machines in subscription subName"

## Examples

In this example, Azure Copilot responds to the prompt "**summarize my Azure Local instances**" with details about the number of instances, their status, and any alerts that affect them.
