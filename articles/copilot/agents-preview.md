# Agents (preview) in Azure Copilot

Agents (preview) in Azure Copilot extends the current capabilities of Azure Copilot to provide an agentic, multi-modal cloud interface. By integrating agents into your daily workflows, Azure Copilot can help you migrate, operate, and optimize your workloads to help streamline your cloud adoption and deployment journey. Unlike a patchwork of disconnected AI and automation tools, Azure Copilot is natively built into the Azure platform, bringing together agents, context, and governance.

Azure agent orchestration intelligently surfaces the right agent at the right time to assist you with your request. Currently, the preview features agents that help you with:

- [Deployments and infrastructure](deployment-agent.md)
- [Observability](observability-agent.md)
- [Optimization](optimization-agent.md)
- [Resiliency](resiliency-agent.md)
- [Troubleshooting and support](troubleshooting-agent.md)

In addition to accessing agents that help you with specific tasks, the preview enables new experiences such as full-screen mode and real-time notifications. For files generated by Azure Copilot, such as Terraform configurations, you can [open files directly in Visual Studio Code for the Web](deployment-agent.md#open-in-vs-code) or [create a pull request to add the files to a GitHub repository](deployment-agent.md#github-pull-request-integration).

## Try the preview

Access to Agents (preview) in Azure Copilot is managed at the tenant level. For most Azure tenants, the request to access Agents (preview) is automatically made on your behalf. However, access will be rolled out gradually over time. Administrators can confirm or update preferences at any time. For more information, see [Manage access to Agents (preview) in Azure Copilot](manage-agents-preview.md). If you have questions, check with your tenant administrator.

Access to Agents (preview) in Azure Copilot is subject to Microsoft's sole discretion. Agents (preview) in Azure Copilot is made available to customers under the terms governing their subscription to Microsoft Azure Services. Review these terms carefully as they contain important conditions and obligations.

If your access request is approved, all users in the tenant who can access Azure Copilot will also have access to Agents (preview) in Azure Copilot. As new agent capabilities become available, they automatically become available to your users. Administrators can continue to [limit Azure Copilot access to specific Microsoft Entra users or groups](manage-access.md#manage-user-access-to-azure-copilot).

## Use agent capabilities

Once your tenant has access to agents (preview) in Azure Copilot, start a conversation as you normally would, then select the agent mode icon.

After you select the icon, agent mode is enabled for the current conversation.

With agent mode, whenever your request involves an agent capability, Azure Copilot intelligently surfaces the right agent at the right time to assist you with your request. Conversations that involve agents have new capabilities, including the ability for agents to take actions on your behalf. You can review what the agents propose, and confirm if you'd like to proceed. No actions are performed without approval. Agents (preview) in Azure Copilot can also produce artifacts such as scripts that you can deploy to your Azure environment.

## Current limitations
