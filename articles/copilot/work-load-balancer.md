# Work with Azure Load Balancer

Microsoft Copilot in Azure can help you work more effectively with [Azure Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview). You can ask Copilot in Azure to help you understand what type of load balancer is right for your requirements. You can also get help if you need to upgrade from Basic Load Balancer to Standard Load Balancer.

## Choose the right load balancer

Copilot in Azure can recommend the best type of load balancer to fit your scenario. When you ask for help choosing a load balancer, Copilot in Azure asks questions to help understand your needs, then provides recommendations. Copilot in Azure also gives you the option to go directly to the **Create load balancer** experience to set up the load balancer.

### Load balancer recommendation sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to get load balancer recommendations. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to create different kinds of queries.

- "Which type of load balancer should I use"
- "Can you help me to choose a load balancer"
- "Which type of load balancer fit my scenario best"
- "I want to know which type of load balancer should I use"
- "Help me choose a load balancer by providing me a questionnaire"

### Load balancer recommendation example

When you say "**Which type of load balancer should I use**", Copilot in Azure asks questions to better understand your scenario. After that, it provides a recommendation, along with a link to create your load balancer.

## Upgrade to Standard Load Balancer

On September 30, 2025, Basic Load Balancer [will be retired](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer/). If you currently use Basic Load Balancer, Copilot in Azure can help you understand the advantages of Standard Load Balancer and how to migrate from Basic to Standard.

To get help upgrading to Standard Load Balancer, navigate to your Basic Load Balancer, then select the banner that appears near the top of the pane. Select one of the provided prompts to get assistance from Copilot in Azure.
