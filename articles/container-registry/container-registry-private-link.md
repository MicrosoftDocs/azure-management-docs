# Customer intent: As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up a private endpoint for an Azure container registry, so that I can secure access over a private link within my virtual network and eliminate exposure to the public internet.

# Connect privately to an Azure container registry using Azure Private Link

Limit access to a registry by assigning virtual network private IP addresses to the registry endpoints and using [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview). Network traffic between the clients on the virtual network and the registry's private endpoints traverses the virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet. Private Link also enables private registry access from on-premises through [Azure ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction), private peering, or a [VPN gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways).

You can [configure DNS settings](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#dns-configuration) for the registry's private endpoints, so that the settings resolve to the registry's allocated private IP address. With DNS configuration, clients and services in the network can continue to access the registry at the registry's fully qualified domain name, such as *myregistry.azurecr.io*. 

This article shows how to configure a private endpoint for your registry using the Azure portal (recommended) or the Azure CLI. This feature is available in the **Premium** container registry service tier. For information about registry service tiers and limits, see [Azure Container Registry tiers](container-registry-skus.md).

[!INCLUDE [container-registry-scanning-limitation](./includes/container-registry-scanning-limitation.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Starting from October 2021, new container registries allow a maximum of 200 private endpoints. Registries created earlier allow a maximum of 10 private endpoints. Use the [az acr show-usage](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-show-usage) command to see the limit for your registry. Please open a support ticket to increase the limit to 200 private endpoints.

## Prerequisites

* A virtual network and subnet in which to set up the private endpoint. If needed, [create a new virtual network and subnet](/azure/virtual-network/quick-create-portal).
* For testing, it's recommended to set up a VM in the virtual network. For steps to create a test virtual machine to access your registry, see [Create a Docker-enabled virtual machine](container-registry-vnet.md#create-a-docker-enabled-virtual-machine). 
* To use the Azure CLI steps in this article, Azure CLI version 2.6.0 or later is recommended. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli]. Or run in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).
* If you don't already have a container registry, create one (Premium tier required) and [import](container-registry-import-images.md) a sample public image such as `mcr.microsoft.com/hello-world` from Microsoft Container Registry. For example, use the [Azure portal][quickstart-portal] or the [Azure CLI][quickstart-cli] to create a registry.

### Register container registry resource provider

To configure registry access using a private link in a different Azure subscription or tenant, you need to [register the resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types) for Azure Container Registry in that subscription. Use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or other tools.

Example:

```azurecli
az account set --subscription <Name or ID of subscription of private link>

az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
``` 

## Set up private endpoint - portal (recommended)

1. Select **Review + create**. You're taken to the **Review + create** page where Azure validates your configuration. 
1. When you see the **Validation passed** message, select **Create**.

### Confirm endpoint configuration

After the private endpoint is created, DNS settings in the private zone appear with the **Private endpoints** settings in the portal:

1. In the portal, navigate to your container registry and select **Settings > Networking**.
1. On the **Private endpoints** tab, select the private endpoint you created. 
1. Select **DNS configuration**.
1. Review the link settings and custom DNS settings.

:::image type="content" source="media/container-registry-private-link/private-endpoint-overview.png" alt-text="Endpoint DNS settings in portal":::
## Set up private endpoint - CLI

The Azure CLI examples in this article use the following environment variables. You'll need the names of an existing container registry, virtual network, and subnet to set up a private endpoint. Substitute values appropriate for your environment. All examples are formatted for the Bash shell:

```bash
REGISTRY_NAME=<container-registry-name>
REGISTRY_LOCATION=<container-registry-location> # Azure region such as westeurope where registry created
RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource-group-name> # Resource group for your existing virtual network and subnet
NETWORK_NAME=<virtual-network-name>
SUBNET_NAME=<subnet-name>
```
### Disable network policies in subnet

[Disable network policies](/azure/private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy) such as network security groups in the subnet for the private endpoint. Update your subnet configuration with [az network vnet subnet update][az-network-vnet-subnet-update]:

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet update \
 --name $SUBNET_NAME \
 --vnet-name $NETWORK_NAME \
 --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
 --disable-private-endpoint-network-policies
```

### Configure the private DNS zone

Create a [private Azure DNS zone](/azure/dns/private-dns-privatednszone) for the private Azure container registry domain. In later steps, you create DNS records for your registry domain in this DNS zone. For more information, see [DNS configuration options](#dns-configuration-options), later in this article.

To use a private zone to override the default DNS resolution for your Azure container registry, the zone must be named **privatelink.azurecr.io**. Run the following [az network private-dns zone create][az-network-private-dns-zone-create] command to create the private zone:

```azurecli
az network private-dns zone create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --name "privatelink.azurecr.io"
```

### Create an association link

Run [az network private-dns link vnet create][az-network-private-dns-link-vnet-create] to associate your private zone with the virtual network. This example creates a link called *myDNSLink*.

```azurecli
az network private-dns link vnet create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --zone-name "privatelink.azurecr.io" \
  --name MyDNSLink \
  --virtual-network $NETWORK_NAME \
  --registration-enabled false
```

### Create a private registry endpoint

In this section, create the registry's private endpoint in the virtual network. First, get the resource ID of your registry:

```azurecli
REGISTRY_ID=$(az acr show --name $REGISTRY_NAME \
  --query 'id' --output tsv)
```

Run the [az network private-endpoint create][az-network-private-endpoint-create] command to create the registry's private endpoint.

The following example creates the endpoint *myPrivateEndpoint* and service connection *myConnection*. To specify a container registry resource for the endpoint, pass `--group-ids registry`:

```azurecli
az network private-endpoint create \
    --name myPrivateEndpoint \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --vnet-name $NETWORK_NAME \
    --subnet $SUBNET_NAME \
    --private-connection-resource-id $REGISTRY_ID \
    --group-ids registry \
    --connection-name myConnection
```

### Get endpoint IP configuration

To configure DNS records, get the IP configuration of the private endpoint. Associated with the private endpoint's network interface in this example are two private IP addresses for the container registry: one for the registry itself, and one for the registry's data endpoint. If your registry is geo-replicated, an additional IP address is associated with each replica.

First, run [az network private-endpoint show][az-network-private-endpoint-show] to query the private endpoint for the network interface ID:

```azurecli
NETWORK_INTERFACE_ID=$(az network private-endpoint show \
  --name myPrivateEndpoint \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --query 'networkInterfaces[0].id' \
  --output tsv)
```

The following [az network nic show][az-network-nic-show] commands get the private IP addresses and FQDNs for the container registry and the registry's data endpoint:

```azurecli
REGISTRY_PRIVATE_IP=$(az network nic show \
  --ids $NETWORK_INTERFACE_ID \
  --query "ipConfigurations[?privateLinkConnectionProperties.requiredMemberName=='registry'].privateIPAddress" \
  --output tsv)

DATA_ENDPOINT_PRIVATE_IP=$(az network nic show \
  --ids $NETWORK_INTERFACE_ID \
  --query "ipConfigurations[?privateLinkConnectionProperties.requiredMemberName=='registry_data_$REGISTRY_LOCATION'].privateIPAddress" \
  --output tsv)

# An FQDN is associated with each IP address in the IP configurations

REGISTRY_FQDN=$(az network nic show \
  --ids $NETWORK_INTERFACE_ID \
  --query "ipConfigurations[?privateLinkConnectionProperties.requiredMemberName=='registry'].privateLinkConnectionProperties.fqdns" \
  --output tsv)

DATA_ENDPOINT_FQDN=$(az network nic show \
  --ids $NETWORK_INTERFACE_ID \
  --query "ipConfigurations[?privateLinkConnectionProperties.requiredMemberName=='registry_data_$REGISTRY_LOCATION'].privateLinkConnectionProperties.fqdns" \
  --output tsv)
```

#### Additional endpoints for geo-replicas

If your registry is [geo-replicated](container-registry-geo-replication.md), query for the additional data endpoint for each registry replica. For example, in the *eastus* region: 

```azurecli
REPLICA_LOCATION=eastus
GEO_REPLICA_DATA_ENDPOINT_PRIVATE_IP=$(az network nic show \
  --ids $NETWORK_INTERFACE_ID \
  --query "ipConfigurations[?privateLinkConnectionProperties.requiredMemberName=='registry_data_$REPLICA_LOCATION'].privateIPAddress" \
  --output tsv) 

GEO_REPLICA_DATA_ENDPOINT_FQDN=$(az network nic show \
  --ids $NETWORK_INTERFACE_ID \
  --query "ipConfigurations[?privateLinkConnectionProperties.requiredMemberName=='registry_data_$REPLICA_LOCATION'].privateLinkConnectionProperties.fqdns" \
  --output tsv)
```

Once a new geo-replication is added, a private endpoint connection is set to be pending. To approve a private endpoint connection configured manually run [az acr private-endpoint-connection approve][az-acr-private-endpoint-connection-approve] command.

### Create DNS records in the private zone

The following commands create DNS records in the private zone for the registry endpoint and its data endpoint. For example, if you have a registry named *myregistry* in the *westeurope* region, the endpoint names are `myregistry.azurecr.io` and `myregistry.westeurope.data.azurecr.io`. 

First run [az network private-dns record-set a create][az-network-private-dns-record-set-a-create] to create empty A-record sets for the registry endpoint and data endpoint:

```azurecli
az network private-dns record-set a create \
  --name $REGISTRY_NAME \
  --zone-name privatelink.azurecr.io \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP

# Specify registry region in data endpoint name
az network private-dns record-set a create \
  --name ${REGISTRY_NAME}.${REGISTRY_LOCATION}.data \
  --zone-name privatelink.azurecr.io \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

Run the [az network private-dns record-set a add-record][az-network-private-dns-record-set-a-add-record] command to create the A-records for the registry endpoint and data endpoint:

```azurecli
az network private-dns record-set a add-record \
  --record-set-name $REGISTRY_NAME \
  --zone-name privatelink.azurecr.io \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --ipv4-address $REGISTRY_PRIVATE_IP

# Specify registry region in data endpoint name
az network private-dns record-set a add-record \
  --record-set-name ${REGISTRY_NAME}.${REGISTRY_LOCATION}.data \
  --zone-name privatelink.azurecr.io \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --ipv4-address $DATA_ENDPOINT_PRIVATE_IP
```

#### Additional records for geo-replicas

If your registry is geo-replicated, create additional DNS settings for each replica. Continuing the example in the *eastus* region:

```azurecli
az network private-dns record-set a create \
  --name ${REGISTRY_NAME}.${REPLICA_LOCATION}.data \
  --zone-name privatelink.azurecr.io \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP

az network private-dns record-set a add-record \
  --record-set-name ${REGISTRY_NAME}.${REPLICA_LOCATION}.data \
  --zone-name privatelink.azurecr.io \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --ipv4-address $GEO_REPLICA_DATA_ENDPOINT_PRIVATE_IP
```

The private link is now configured and ready for use.

## Disable public access

For many scenarios, disable registry access from public networks. This configuration prevents clients outside the virtual network from reaching the registry endpoints. 

### Disable public access - portal

1. In the portal, navigate to your container registry and select **Settings > Networking**.
1. On the **Public access** tab, in **Allow public network access**, select **Disabled**. Then select **Save**.

### Disable public access - CLI

> [!NOTE]
>If the public access is disabled, the `az acr build` commands will no longer work.

To disable public access using the Azure CLI, run [az acr update][az-acr-update] and set `--public-network-enabled` to `false`. 

```azurecli
az acr update --name $REGISTRY_NAME --public-network-enabled false
```

## Execute the `az acr build` with private endpoint and private registry

> [!NOTE]
> Once you disable public network [access here](#disable-public-access), then `az acr build` commands will no longer work.
> Unless you are utilizing dedicated agent pools, it's typically require the public IP's. Tasks reserve a set of public IPs in each region for outbound requests. If needed, we have the option to add these IPs to our firewall's allowed list for seamless communication.`az acr build` command uses the same set of IPs as the tasks.

Consider the following options to execute the `az acr build` successfully.

* Assign a [dedicated agent pool.](./tasks-agent-pools.md) 
* If agent pool is not available in the region, add the regional [Azure Container Registry Service Tag IPv4](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#use-the-service-tag-discovery-api) to the [firewall access rules](./container-registry-firewall-access-rules.md#allow-access-by-ip-address-range). Tasks reserve a set of public IPs in each region (a.k.a. AzureContainerRegistry Service Tag) for outbound requests. You can choose to add the IPs in the firewall allowed list.

## Disable access to a container registry using a service endpoint 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The container registry does not support enabling both private link and service endpoint features configured from a virtual network.

Once the registry has public access disabled and private link configured, you can disable the service endpoint access to a container registry from a virtual network by [removing virtual network rules.](container-registry-vnet.md#remove-network-rules)

* Run [`az acr network-rule list`](/cli/azure/acr/network-rule#az-acr-network-rule-list) command to list the existing network rules.
* Run [`az acr network-rule remove`](/cli/azure/acr/network-rule#az-acr-network-rule-remove) command to remove the network rule. 

## Validate private link connection

You should validate that the resources within the subnet of the private endpoint connect to your registry over a private IP address, and have the correct private DNS zone integration.

To validate the private link connection, connect to the virtual machine you set up in the virtual network.

Run a utility such as `nslookup` or `dig` to look up the IP address of your registry over the private link. For example:

```bash
dig $REGISTRY_NAME.azurecr.io
```

Example output shows the registry's IP address in the address space of the subnet:

```console
[...]
; <<>> DiG 9.11.3-1ubuntu1.13-Ubuntu <<>> myregistry.azurecr.io
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 52155
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 65494
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;myregistry.azurecr.io.         IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:

myregistry.privatelink.azurecr.io. 10 IN A      10.0.0.7

[...]
```

Compare this result with the public IP address in `dig` output for the same registry over a public endpoint:

```console
[...]
;; ANSWER SECTION:
myregistry.azurecr.io.	2881	IN	CNAME	myregistry.privatelink.azurecr.io.

xxxx.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com. 10	IN A 20.45.122.144

[...]
```

### Registry operations over private link

Also verify that you can perform registry operations from the virtual machine in the network. Make an SSH connection to your virtual machine, and run [az acr login][az-acr-login] to login to your registry. Depending on your VM configuration, you might need to prefix the following commands with `sudo`.

```azurecli
az acr login --name $REGISTRY_NAME
```

Perform registry operations such as `docker pull` to pull a sample image from the registry. Replace `hello-world:v1` with an image and tag appropriate for your registry, prefixed with the registry login server name (all lowercase):

```bash
docker pull myregistry.azurecr.io/hello-world:v1
``` 

Docker successfully pulls the image to the VM.

## Manage private endpoint connections

Manage a registry's private endpoint connections using the Azure portal, or by using commands in the [az acr private-endpoint-connection][az-acr-private-endpoint-connection] command group. Operations include approve, delete, list, reject, or show details of a registry's private endpoint connections.

For example, to list the private endpoint connections of a registry, run the [az acr private-endpoint-connection list][az-acr-private-endpoint-connection-list] command. For example:

```azurecli
az acr private-endpoint-connection list \
  --registry-name $REGISTRY_NAME 
```

When you set up a private endpoint connection using the steps in this article, the registry automatically accepts connections from clients and services that have Azure RBAC permissions on the registry. You can set up the endpoint to require manual approval of connections. For information about how to approve and reject private endpoint connections, see [Manage a Private Endpoint Connection](/azure/private-link/manage-private-endpoint).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, if you delete a private endpoint from a registry, you might also need to delete the virtual network's link to the private zone. If the link isn't deleted, you may see an error similar to `unresolvable host`.

## DNS configuration options

The private endpoint in this example integrates with a private DNS zone associated with a basic virtual network. This setup uses the Azure-provided DNS service directly to resolve the registry's public FQDN to its private IP addresses in the virtual network. 

Private link supports additional DNS configuration scenarios that use the private zone, including with custom DNS solutions. For example, you might have a custom DNS solution deployed in the virtual network, or on-premises in a network you connect to the virtual network using a VPN gateway or Azure ExpressRoute. 

To resolve the registry's public FQDN to the private IP address in these scenarios, you need to configure a server-level forwarder to the Azure DNS service (168.63.129.16). Exact configuration options and steps depend on your existing networks and DNS. For examples, see [Azure Private Endpoint DNS configuration](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-dns).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If for high availability you created private endpoints in several regions, we recommend that you use a separate resource group in each region and place the virtual network and the associated private DNS zone in it. This configuration also prevents unpredictable DNS resolution caused by sharing the same private DNS zone.

### Manually configure DNS records

For some scenarios, you may need to manually configure DNS records in a private zone instead of using the Azure-provided private zone. Be sure to create records for each of the following endpoints: the registry endpoint, the registry's data endpoint, and the data endpoint for any additional regional replica. If all records aren't configured, the registry may be unreachable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you later add a new replica, you need to manually add a new DNS record for the data endpoint in that region. For example, if you create a replica of *myregistry* in the northeurope location, add a record for `myregistry.northeurope.data.azurecr.io`.

The FQDNs and private IP addresses you need to create DNS records are associated with the private endpoint's network interface. You can obtain this information using the Azure portal or Azure CLI.

* In the portal, navigate to your private endpoint, and select **DNS configuration**. 
* Using the Azure CLI, run the [az network nic show][az-network-nic-show] command. For example commands, see [Get endpoint IP configuration](#get-endpoint-ip-configuration), earlier in this article.

After creating DNS records, make sure that the registry FQDNs resolve properly to their respective private IP addresses.

## Clean up resources

To clean up your resources in the portal, navigate to your resource group. Once the resource group is loaded, click on **Delete resource group** to remove the resource group and the resources stored there.

If you created all the Azure resources in the same resource group and no longer need them, you can optionally delete the resources by using a single [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) command:

```azurecli
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

## Integrating with a registry with private link enabled

To pull content from a registry with private link enabled, clients must allow access to the registry REST endpoint, as well as all regional data endpoints. The client proxy or firewall must allow access to

REST endpoint: `{REGISTRY_NAME}.azurecr.io`
Data endpoint(s): `{REGISTRY_NAME}.{REGISTRY_LOCATION}.data.azurecr.io`

For a geo-replicated registry, customer needs to configure access to the data endpoint for each regional replica.

You have to update the routing configuration for the client proxy and client firewall with the data endpoints to handle the pull requests successfully. A client proxy will provide central traffic control to the [outbound requests][outbound-connection]. To handle local traffic a client proxy is not required, you can add into `noProxy` section to bypass the proxy. Learn more about [HTTP proxy doc](/azure/aks/http-proxy) to integrate with AKS. 

Requests to token server over private endpoint connection doesn't require the data endpoint configuration.

## Next steps

* To learn more about Private Link, see the [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) documentation.

* To verify DNS settings in the virtual network that route to a private endpoint, run the [az acr check-health](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-check-health) command with the `--vnet` parameter. For more information, see [Check the health of an Azure container registry](container-registry-check-health.md). 

* If you need to set up registry access rules from behind a client firewall, see [Configure rules to access an Azure container registry behind a firewall](container-registry-firewall-access-rules.md).

* [Troubleshoot Azure Private Endpoint connectivity problems](/azure/private-link/troubleshoot-private-endpoint-connectivity).

* If you need to deploy Azure Container Instances that can pull images from an ACR through a private endpoint, see [Deploy to Azure Container Instances from Azure Container Registry using a managed identity](/azure/container-instances/using-azure-container-registry-mi).
