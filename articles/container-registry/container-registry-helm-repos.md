# Push and pull Helm charts to an Azure container registry

To quickly manage and deploy applications for Kubernetes, you can use the [open-source Helm package manager][helm]. With Helm, application packages are defined as [charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/), which are collected and stored in a [Helm chart repository](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/).

This article shows you how to host Helm charts repositories in an Azure container registry, using Helm 3 commands and storing charts as [OCI artifacts](container-registry-image-formats.md#oci-artifacts). In many scenarios, you would build and upload your own charts for the applications you develop. For more information on how to build your own Helm charts, see the [Chart Template Developer's Guide][develop-helm-charts]. You can also store an existing Helm chart from another Helm repo.

> [!NOTE]
> This article has been updated with Helm 3 commands. Helm 3.7 includes changes to Helm CLI commands and OCI support introduced in earlier versions of Helm 3. By design `helm` advances with version updates. We recommend using **3.7.2** or later.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * In November 2020, Helm 2 reached end-of-support. Last September, we announced that starting on March 30th, 2025 Azure Container Registry would no longer support Helm 2 and Helm repositories. However, we've decided to extend this timeline to give customers more time to complete the migration. **We recommend that you transition to Helm 3 and storing Helm charts as OCI artifacts immediately.**
> * The Azure CLI command [az acr helm push][az-acr-helm-push] has been retired. This prevents pushing new Helm charts to legacy Helm repositories.
> * Starting **September 15, 2025**, the Azure CLI command group [az acr helm][az-acr-helm] will be retired. This will end legacy Helm repository capabilities in Azure Container Registry.
> * ***All Helm charts not stored as an OCI artifact will be deleted from Azure Container Registry starting on September 15, 2025.***
> * ***Learn how to find all Helm charts stored in a Helm repository here: [az acr helm list][az-acr-helm-list]. If the Helm chart you are using is listed, then it is stored in a legacy Helm repository and is at risk of deletion.***

To store, manage, and install Helm charts, you use commands in the Helm CLI. Major Helm releases include Helm 3 and Helm 2. For details on the version differences, see the [version FAQ](https://helm.sh/docs/faq/).

## Migrate from Helm 2 to Helm 3

If you've previously stored and deployed charts using Helm 2 and Azure Container Registry, we recommend migrating to Helm 3. See:

* [Migrating Helm 2 to 3](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/) in the Helm documentation.
* [Migrate your registry to store Helm OCI artifacts](#migrate-your-registry-to-store-helm-oci-artifacts), later in this article

Helm 3 should be used to host Helm charts in Azure Container Registry. With Helm 3, you:

* Can store and manage Helm charts in repositories in an Azure container registry
* Store Helm charts in your registry as [OCI artifacts](container-registry-image-formats.md#oci-artifacts). Azure Container Registry provides GA support for OCI artifacts, including Helm charts.
* Authenticate with your registry using the `helm registry login` or `az acr login` command.
* Use `helm` commands to push, pull, and manage Helm charts in a registry
* Use `helm install` to install charts to a Kubernetes cluster from the registry.

### Feature support

Azure Container Registry supports specific Helm chart management features depending on whether you are using Helm 3 (current) or Helm 2 (deprecated).

| Feature | Helm 2 | Helm 3 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Manage charts using `az acr helm` commands | :heavy_check_mark: | |
| Store charts as OCI artifacts | | :heavy_check_mark:  |
| Manage charts using `az acr repository` commands and the **Repositories** blade in Azure portal| | :heavy_check_mark:  |

### Chart version compatibility

The following Helm [chart versions](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) can be stored in Azure Container Registry and are installable by the Helm 2 and Helm 3 clients. 

| Version | Helm 2 | Helm 3 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| apiVersion v1 | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| apiVersion v2 | | :heavy_check_mark: |


## Prerequisites

The following resources are needed for the scenario in this article:

- **An Azure container registry** in your Azure subscription. If needed, create a registry using the [Azure portal](container-registry-get-started-portal.md) or the [Azure CLI](container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md).
- **Helm client version 3.7 or later** - Run `helm version` to find your current version. For more information on how to install and upgrade Helm, see [Installing Helm][helm-install]. If you upgrade from an earlier version of Helm 3, review the [release notes](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases).
- **A Kubernetes cluster** where you will install a Helm chart. If needed, create an AKS cluster [using the Azure CLI](/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [using Azure PowerShell](/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or [using the Azure portal](/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).
- **Azure CLI version 2.0.71 or later** - Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Set up Helm client

Use the `helm version` command to verify that you have installed Helm 3:

```console
helm version
```

> [!NOTE]
> The version indicated must be at least 3.8.0, as OCI support in earlier versions was experimental.

Set the following environment variables for the target registry. The ACR_NAME is the registry resource name. If the ACR registry url is myregistry.azurecr.io, set the ACR_NAME to myregistry

```console
ACR_NAME=<container-registry-name>
```

## Create a sample chart

Create a test chart using the following commands:

```console
mkdir helmtest

cd helmtest
helm create hello-world
```

As a basic example, change directory to the `templates` folder and first delete the contents there:

```console
cd hello-world/templates
rm -rf *
```

In the `templates` folder, create a file called `configmap.yaml`, by running the following command:

```console
cat <<EOF > configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: hello-world-configmap
data:
  myvalue: "Hello World"
EOF
```

For more about creating and running this example, see [Getting Started](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/) in the Helm Docs.

## Save chart to local archive

Change directory to the `hello-world` subdirectory. Then, run `helm package` to save the chart to a local archive. 

In the following example, the chart is saved with the name and version in `Chart.yaml`.

```console
cd ..
helm package .
```

Output is similar to:

```output
Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /my/path/hello-world-0.1.0.tgz
```

## Authenticate with the registry

Run  `helm registry login` to authenticate with the registry. You may pass [registry credentials](container-registry-authentication.md) appropriate for your scenario, such as service principal credentials, user identity, or a repository-scoped token.

- Authenticate with a Microsoft Entra [service principal with pull and push permissions](container-registry-auth-service-principal.md#create-a-service-principal) to the registry.
  - If your registry is enabled for [Microsoft Entra attribute-based access control (ABAC) to manage Microsoft Entra-based repository permissions](container-registry-rbac-abac-repository-permissions.md), you must use the `Container Registry Repository Writer` role. Otherwise if your registry is not enabled for ABAC, use the older `AcrPush` role.
  ```azurecli
  SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME=<acr-helm-sp>
  ACR_REGISTRY_ID=$(az acr show --name $ACR_NAME --query id --output tsv)
  ROLE="Container Registry Repository Writer" # for ABAC-enabled registries. Otherwise use AcrPush for non-ABAC registries.
  PASSWORD=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME \
            --scopes $(az acr show --name $ACR_NAME --query id --output tsv) \
             --role "$ROLE" \
            --query "password" --output tsv)
  USER_NAME=$(az identity show -n $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME -g $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID --query "clientId" -o tsv)
  ```
- Authenticate with your [individual Microsoft Entra identity](container-registry-authentication.md?tabs=azure-cli#individual-login-with-azure-ad) to push and pull Helm charts using an AD token.
  ```azurecli
  USER_NAME="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  PASSWORD=$(az acr login --name $ACR_NAME --expose-token --output tsv --query accessToken)
  ```
- Authenticate with a [repository scoped token using non-Entra token-based repository permissions](container-registry-token-based-repository-permissions.md).
  ```azurecli
  USER_NAME="helmtoken"
  PASSWORD=$(az acr token create -n $USER_NAME \
                    -r $ACR_NAME \
                    --scope-map _repositories_admin \
                    --only-show-errors \
                    --query "credentials.passwords[0].value" -o tsv)
  ```
- Then supply the credentials to `helm registry login`.
  ```bash
  helm registry login $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io \
    --username $USER_NAME \
    --password $PASSWORD
  ```

## Push chart to registry as OCI artifact

Run the `helm push` command in the Helm 3 CLI to push the chart archive to the fully qualified target repository. Separate the words in the chart names and use only lower case letters and numbers. In the following example, the target repository namespace is `helm/hello-world`, and the chart is tagged `0.1.0`:

```console
helm push hello-world-0.1.0.tgz oci://$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/helm
```

After a successful push, output is similar to:

```output
Pushed: <registry>.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world:0.1.0
digest: sha256:5899db028dcf96aeaabdadfa5899db02589b2899b025899b059db02
```

## List charts in the repository

As with images stored in an Azure container registry, you can use [az acr repository][az-acr-repository] commands to show the repositories hosting your charts, and chart tags and manifests. 

For example, run [az acr repository show][az-acr-repository-show] to see the properties of the repo you created in the previous step:

```azurecli
az acr repository show \
  --name $ACR_NAME \
  --repository helm/hello-world
```

Output is similar to:

```output
{
  "changeableAttributes": {
    "deleteEnabled": true,
    "listEnabled": true,
    "readEnabled": true,
    "writeEnabled": true
  },
  "createdTime": "2021-10-05T12:11:37.6701689Z",
  "imageName": "helm/hello-world",
  "lastUpdateTime": "2021-10-05T12:11:37.7637082Z",
  "manifestCount": 1,
  "registry": "mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io",
  "tagCount": 1
}
```

Run the [az acr manifest list-metadata][az-acr-manifest-list-metadata] command to see details of the chart stored in the repository. For example:

```azurecli
az acr manifest list-metadata \
  --registry $ACR_NAME \
  --name helm/hello-world
```

Output, abbreviated in this example, shows a `configMediaType` of `application/vnd.cncf.helm.config.v1+json`:

```output
[
  {
    [...]
    "configMediaType": "application/vnd.cncf.helm.config.v1+json",
    "createdTime": "2021-10-05T12:11:37.7167893Z",
    "digest": "sha256:0c03b71c225c3ddff53660258ea16ca7412b53b1f6811bf769d8c85a1f0663ee",
    "imageSize": 3301,
    "lastUpdateTime": "2021-10-05T12:11:37.7167893Z",
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
    "tags": [
      "0.1.0"
    ]
```

## Install Helm chart

Run `helm install` to install the Helm chart you pushed to the registry. The chart tag is passed using the `--version` parameter. Specify a release name such as *myhelmtest*, or pass the `--generate-name` parameter. For example:

```console
helm install myhelmtest oci://$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world --version 0.1.0
```

Output after successful chart installation is similar to:

```console
NAME: myhelmtest
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Oct  4 16:59:51 2021
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

To verify the installation, run the `helm get manifest` command. 

```console
helm get manifest myhelmtest
```

The command returns the YAML data in your `configmap.yaml` template file.

Run `helm uninstall` to uninstall the chart release on your cluster:

```console
helm uninstall myhelmtest
```

## Pull chart to local archive

You can optionally pull a chart from the container registry to a local archive using `helm pull`. The chart tag is passed using the `--version` parameter. If a local archive exists at the current path, this command overwrites it.

```console
helm pull oci://$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world --version 0.1.0
```

## Delete chart from the registry

To delete a chart from the container registry, use the [az acr repository delete][az-acr-repository-delete] command. Run the following command and confirm the operation when prompted:

```azurecli
az acr repository delete --name $ACR_NAME --image helm/hello-world:0.1.0
```

## Migrate your registry to store Helm OCI artifacts

If you previously set up your Azure container registry as a chart repository using Helm 2 and the `az acr helm` commands, we recommend that you [upgrade][helm-install] to the Helm 3 client. Then, follow these steps to store the charts as OCI artifacts in your registry. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * After you complete migration from a Helm 2-style (index.yaml-based) chart repository to OCI artifact repositories, use the Helm CLI and `az acr repository` commands to manage the charts. See previous sections in this article. 
> * The Helm OCI artifact repositories are not discoverable using Helm commands such as `helm search` and `helm repo list`. For more information about Helm commands used to store charts as OCI artifacts, see the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/).

### Enable OCI support (enabled by default in Helm v3.8.0)

Ensure that you are using the Helm 3 client:

```console
helm version
```

If you are using Helm v3.8.0 or higher, this is enabled by default. If you are using a lower version, you can enable OCI support setting the environment variable:

```console
export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
```

### List current charts

List the charts currently stored in the registry, here named *myregistry*:

```console
helm search repo myregistry
```

Output shows the charts and chart versions:

```
NAME                            CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION                                       
myregistry/ingress-nginx        3.20.1          0.43.0          Ingress controller for Kubernetes...
myregistry/wordpress            9.0.3           5.3.2           Web publishing platform for building...
[...]
```

### Pull chart archives locally

For each chart in the repo, pull the chart archive locally, and take note of the filename:

```console 
helm pull myregisry/ingress-nginx
ls *.tgz
```

A local chart archive such as `ingress-nginx-3.20.1.tgz` is created.

### Push charts as OCI artifacts to registry

Log in to the registry:

```azurecli
az acr login --name $ACR_NAME
```

Push each chart archive to the registry. Example:

```console
helm push ingress-nginx-3.20.1.tgz oci://$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/helm
```

After pushing a chart, confirm it is stored in the registry:

```azurecli
az acr repository list --name $ACR_NAME
```

After pushing all of the charts, optionally remove the Helm 2-style chart repository from the registry. Doing so reduces storage in your registry:

```console
helm repo remove $ACR_NAME
```
