# Customer intent: As a cloud administrator, I want to enable the soft delete policy for Azure Container Registry artifacts so that I can recover accidentally deleted items within a specified retention period, ensuring data integrity and minimizing potential data loss.

# Recover deleted artifacts with soft delete policy in Azure Container Registry (Preview)

Azure Container Registry (ACR) allows you to enable the *soft delete policy* to recover any accidentally deleted artifacts for a set retention period.

## Aspects of soft delete policy

The soft delete policy can be enabled/disabled at any time. Once you enable the soft-delete policy in ACR, it manages the deleted artifacts as soft deleted artifacts with a set retention period. Thereby you have ability to list, filter, and restore the soft deleted artifacts. 

### Retention period

The default retention period for soft deleted artifacts is seven days, but itâ€™s possible to set the retention period value between one to 90 days. You can set, update, and change the retention policy value. The soft deleted artifacts expire once the retention period is complete. 

### Autopurge

The autopurge runs every 24 hours and always considers the current value of retention days before permanently deleting the soft deleted artifacts. For example, after five days of soft deleting the artifact, if you change the value of retention days from seven to 14 days, the artifact will only expire after 14 days from the initial soft delete.

## Availability and pricing information

This feature is available in all the service tiers (also known as SKUs). For information about registry service tiers, see [Azure Container Registry service tiers](container-registry-skus.md).

> [!NOTE]
>The soft deleted artifacts are billed as per active sku pricing for storage.

## Preview limitations 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The soft delete policy is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

* ACR currently doesn't support manually purging soft deleted artifacts. 
* The soft delete policy doesn't support registries configured for zone redundancy or geo-replication.
* ACR doesn't allow enabling both the retention policy and the soft delete policy. See [retention policy for untagged manifests.](container-registry-retention-policy.md)


## Prerequisites

* The user requires following permissions (at registry level) to perform soft delete operations:

| Permission                                                    | Description                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/deleted/read           | List soft-deleted artifacts   |
| Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/deleted/restore/action | Restore soft-deleted artifact |

* You can use the Azure Cloud Shell or a local installation of the Azure CLI to run the command examples in this article. If you'd like to use it locally, version 2.0.74 or later is required. Run `az --version` for the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

* Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 

## Enable soft delete policy for registry - CLI

1. Update soft delete policy for a given `MyRegistry` ACR with a retention period set between 1 to 90 days.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr config soft-delete update -r MyRegistry --days 7 --status <enabled/disabled>
    ```

2. Show configured soft delete policy for a given `MyRegistry` ACR.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr config soft-delete show -r MyRegistry 
    ```

### List the soft deleted artifacts- CLI

The `az acr repository list-deleted` commands enable fetching and listing of the soft deleted repositories. For more information use `--help`.

1. List the soft deleted repositories in a given `MyRegistry` ACR.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr repository list-deleted -n MyRegistry
    ```

The `az acr manifest list-deleted` commands enable fetching and listing of the soft delete manifests.

2. List the soft deleted manifests of a `hello-world` repository in a given `MyRegistry` ACR.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr manifest list-deleted -r MyRegistry -n hello-world
    ```

The `az acr manifest list-deleted-tags` commands  enable fetching and listing of the soft delete tags.

3. List the soft delete tags of a `hello-world` repository in a given `MyRegistry` ACR.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr manifest list-deleted-tags -r MyRegistry -n hello-world
    ```

4. Filter the soft delete tags of a `hello-world` repository to match tag `latest` in a given `MyRegistry` ACR.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr manifest list-deleted-tags -r MyRegistry -n hello-world:latest
    ```

### Restore the soft deleted artifacts - CLI

The `az acr manifest restore` commands restore a single image by tag and digest. 

1. Restore the image of a `hello-world` repository by tag `latest`and digest `sha256:abc123` in a given `MyRegistry` ACR.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr manifest restore -r MyRegistry -n hello-world:latest -d sha256:abc123
    ```

2. Restore the most recently deleted manifest of a `hello-world` repository by tag `latest` in a given `MyRegistry` ACR.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr manifest restore -r MyRegistry -n hello-world:latest
    ```

Force restore overwrites the existing tag with the same name in the repository. If the soft delete policy is enabled during force restore. The overwritten tag is soft deleted. You can force restore with specific arguments `--force, -f`.  

3. Force restore the image of a `hello-world` repository by tag `latest`and digest `sha256:abc123` in a given `MyRegistry` ACR.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr manifest restore -r MyRegistry -n hello-world:latest -d sha256:abc123 -f
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Restoring a [manifest list](push-multi-architecture-images.md#manifest-list) won't recursively restore any underlying soft deleted manifests.
> If you're restoring soft deleted [ORAS artifacts](container-registry-manage-artifact.md), then restoring a subject doesn't recursively restore the referrer chain. Also, the subject has to be restored first, only then a referrer manifest is allowed to restore. Otherwise it throws an error.

## Enable soft delete policy for registry - Portal

You can also enable a registry's soft delete policy in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 

1. Navigate to your Azure Container Registry. 
2. In the **Overview tab**, verify the status of the **Soft Delete** (Preview).
3. If the **Status** is **Disabled**, Select **Update**.
