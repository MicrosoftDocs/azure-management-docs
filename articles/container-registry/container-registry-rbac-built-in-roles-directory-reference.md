# Azure Container Registry roles directory reference

This directory provides a comprehensive reference of all built-in roles available for Azure Container Registry (ACR).
This document is designed for expert users who need detailed knowledge of ACR permissions in built-in roles for identity management, auditing, security, or custom role design.
Each ACR built-in role is documented here with its included control plane and data plane permissions.

The following built-in role types are available:
- [Control plane roles](#control-plane-roles)
- [Data plane roles](#data-plane-roles)
- [Privileged roles](#privileged-roles)

For a high-level overview of these built-in roles—including supported role assignment identity types, steps to perform a role assignment, and recommended roles for common scenarios—see [Azure Container Registry built-in roles](container-registry-rbac-built-in-roles-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The applicable built-in roles and role behavior depends on the registry's "Role assignment permissions mode." This is visible in the "Properties" blade in the Azure portal:
> - **RBAC Registry + ABAC Repository Permissions**: Supports standard RBAC role assignments with optional Microsoft Entra ABAC conditions to scope assignments to specific repositories.
> - **RBAC Registry Permissions**: Supports only standard RBAC assignments without ABAC conditions.
> For details on Microsoft Entra ABAC and ABAC-enabled roles, see [Microsoft Entra-based repository permissions](container-registry-rbac-abac-repository-permissions.md).

## Built-in roles reference

Each built-in role includes a set of permissions (actions and data actions) that control what operations can be performed on the registry. These permissions fall into two categories:
- Control plane permissions: Create, manage, delete, and configure ACR registries, registry-wide configurations, and registry-wide policies.
- Data plane permissions: Perform operations that read, modify, or delete data within a registry, such as pushing, pulling, modifying, or deleting images, artifacts, and tags within the registry. Also includes operations that modify repository-specific configurations and repository-specific policies.

### Control plane roles

The following built-in roles are control plane roles. Assign these roles to identities that need to manage registries, but don't require data plane permissions.

The applicable roles and role behavior depends on the registry's "Role assignment permissions mode." This is visible in the "Properties" blade in the Azure portal. For more information on Entra ABAC, see [Entra-based repository permissions](container-registry-rbac-abac-repository-permissions.md).

The applicable roles and role behavior depends on the registry's "Role assignment permissions mode." This is visible in the "Properties" blade in the Azure portal.

### Privileged roles

The following built-in roles are privileged roles.
Assign these roles only to trusted identities, as they provide access to a wide range of resources and permissions over other resource types, not just Azure Container Registry.

Azure recommends using less privileged [control plane roles](#control-plane-roles) or [data plane roles](#data-plane-roles) whenever possible instead of these privileged roles.

The applicable roles and role behavior depends on the registry's "Role assignment permissions mode." This is visible in the "Properties" blade in the Azure portal. For more information on Microsoft Entra ABAC, see [Microsoft Entra-based repository permissions](container-registry-rbac-abac-repository-permissions.md).

#### [Registries configured with "RBAC Registry + ABAC Repository Permissions"](#tab/registries-configured-with-rbac-registry-abac-repository-permissions)

##### Owner
- **Use case**: Assign to administrators who need complete control over the registry, including the ability to assign roles to other identities and perform role assignments for the registry.
- **Permissions**: Full access to all registry control plane operations, including [role assignment permissions](container-registry-rbac-built-in-roles-overview.md) and managing [Microsoft Entra-based repository permissions](container-registry-rbac-abac-repository-permissions.md).
  - **Control plane permissions**:
    - Create, update, view, list, and delete registries (including [registry SKUs](container-registry-skus.md) and [availability zones and zone redundancy](zone-redundancy.md))
    - Manage [role assignments for registries](container-registry-rbac-built-in-roles-overview.md)
    - Manage [geo-replications](container-registry-geo-replication.md)
    - Manage [connected registries](intro-connected-registry.md)
    - Manage [ACR tasks](container-registry-tasks-overview.md), task runs, [task agent pools](tasks-agent-pools.md), quick tasks ([quick builds with `az acr build`](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-build) and [quick runs with `az acr run`](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-run)), [task logs](container-registry-tasks-logs.md), and [task identities](container-registry-tasks-authentication-managed-identity.md)
      - Grants permissions to configure an [ACR task's system-assigned managed identity](/cli/azure/acr/identity). Note: to manage an ACR task's user-assigned managed identity, the separate `Managed Identity Operator` role is required.
      - Grants permissions to manage [auto-purge on ACR tasks](container-registry-auto-purge.md)
      - **For ABAC-enabled registries, ACR tasks, quick builds, and quick runs don't have default data plane permissions to push, pull, or delete images and tags within repositories.**
        - ACR tasks belonging to ABAC-enabled registries must have the `Container Registry Repository Reader/Writer/Contributor` and `Container Registry Repository Catalog Lister` roles assigned to the task identity in order to perform data plane operations.
        - For quick builds and quick runs, the identity (caller) invoking the quick task must have the `Container Registry Repository Reader/Writer/Contributor` and `Container Registry Repository Catalog Lister` roles assigned to it in order to perform data plane operations.
    - Configure [artifact cache rules and credential sets](artifact-cache-overview.md)
    - Trigger [ACR image imports with `az acr import`](container-registry-import-images.md)
    - Manage [ACR transfer pipelines for transferring artifacts between registries using intermediary storage accounts across network, tenant, or air gap boundaries](container-registry-transfer-cli.md) (import pipelines, export pipelines, and import/export pipeline runs)
    - Update registry configuration

      - Configure registry policies (configure [retention policy](container-registry-retention-policy.md), [quarantine enablement](https://github.com/Azure/acr/blob/main/docs/preview/quarantine/readme.md), [soft-delete enablement](container-registry-soft-delete-policy.md), and [data exfiltration export policy](data-loss-prevention.md))
    - Configure registry [diagnostics and monitoring settings](monitor-container-registry.md) (diagnostic settings, logs, metrics, [webhooks for registries and geo-replications](container-registry-webhook.md), and [Event Grid](container-registry-event-grid-quickstart.md))

  - **Control plane permissions**:
    - Same as Owner, except for managing or performing [role assignments for registries](container-registry-rbac-built-in-roles-overview.md). Only permissions for viewing and listing role assignments for a registry are granted.
    - Note: to manage or perform role assignments for registries, the `Role Based Access Control Administrator` role is required. This less privileged role is recommended in lieu of the `Owner` role for managing role assignments.
  - **Data plane permissions**:
    - **None - ABAC-enabled registries don't have data plane permissions for the built-in Contributor role.**

##### Reader
