# Monitor Azure Container Registry

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-intro.md)]

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Container Registry and how you can use the features of Azure Monitor to analyze and alert on this data.

## Monitor overview

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each registry includes a brief view of recent resource usage and activity, such as push and pull operations. This high-level information is useful, but only a small amount of data is shown there.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-types](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-types.md)]
For more information about the resource types for Container Registry, see [Azure Container Registry monitoring data reference](monitor-container-registry-reference.md).

## Monitoring data

Azure Container Registry collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data).

See [Monitoring Azure Container Registry data reference](monitor-service-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs created by Azure Container Registry.

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for Azure Container Registry are listed in [Azure Container Registry monitoring data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#resource-logs).

> [!TIP]
> You can also create registry diagnostic settings by navigating to your registry in the portal. In the menu, select **Diagnostic settings** under **Monitoring**.

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-data-storage](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-data-storage.md)]

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-platform-metrics](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-platform-metrics.md)]

For a list of available metrics for Container Registry, see [Azure Container Registry monitoring data reference](monitor-container-registry-reference.md#metrics).

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for an Azure container registry with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics) for details on using this tool.

> [!TIP]
> You can also go to the metrics explorer by navigating to your registry in the portal. In the menu, select **Metrics** under **Monitoring**.

For a list of the platform metrics collected for Azure Container Registry, see [Monitoring Azure Container Registry data reference metrics](monitor-service-reference.md#metrics).

### Azure CLI

The following Azure CLI commands can be used to get information about the Azure Container Registry metrics.

- [az monitor metrics list-definitions](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az-monitor-metrics-list-definitions) - List metric definitions and dimensions
- [az monitor metrics list](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az-monitor-metrics-list) - Retrieve metric values

### REST API

You can use the Azure Monitor REST API to get information programmatically about the Azure Container Registry metrics.

- [List metric definitions and dimensions](/rest/api/monitor/metricdefinitions/list)
- [Retrieve metric values](/rest/api/monitor/metrics/list)

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-logs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-logs.md)]

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema#top-level-common-schema). The schema for Azure Container Registry resource logs is found in the [Azure Container Registry Data Reference](monitor-service-reference.md#schemas).

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) is a platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Azure Container Registry, see [Monitoring Azure Container Registry data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#resource-logs).  

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring Azure Container Reference data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables).  

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the log schemas for Container Registry, see [Azure Container Registry monitoring data reference](monitor-container-registry-reference.md#resource-logs).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-activity-log](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-activity-log.md)]

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-analyze-data](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-analyze-data.md)]

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-external-tools](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-external-tools.md)]

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]

For example, the following query retrieves the most recent 24 hours of data from the **ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents** table:

```Kusto
ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d) 
```

The following image shows sample output:

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-service/azure-monitor-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Query log data in the Azure portal.":::

Following are queries that you can use to help you monitor your registry resource.

Error events from the last hour:

```Kusto
union Event, Syslog // Event table stores Windows event records, Syslog stores Linux records
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventLevelName == "Error" // EventLevelName is used in the Event (Windows) records
    or SeverityLevel== "err" // SeverityLevel is used in Syslog (Linux) records
```

100 most recent registry events:

```Kusto
ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents
| union ContainerRegistryLoginEvents
| top 100 by TimeGenerated
| project TimeGenerated, LoginServer, OperationName, Identity, Repository, DurationMs, Region , ResultType
```

Identity of user or object that deleted repository:

```Kusto
ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents
| where OperationName contains "Delete"
| project LoginServer, OperationName, Repository, Identity, CallerIpAddress
```

Identity of user or object that deleted tag:

```Kusto
ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents
| where OperationName contains "Untag"
| project LoginServer, OperationName, Repository, Tag, Identity, CallerIpAddress
```

Repository-level operation failures:

```kusto
ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents 
| where ResultDescription contains "40"
| project TimeGenerated, OperationName, Repository, Tag, ResultDescription
```

Registry authentication failures:

```kusto
ContainerRegistryLoginEvents 
| where ResultDescription != "200"
| project TimeGenerated, Identity, CallerIpAddress, ResultDescription
```

### Azure Container Registry alert rules

The following table lists some suggested alert rules for Container Registry. These alerts are just examples. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [Azure Container Registry monitoring data reference](monitor-container-registry-reference.md).

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| metric | Signal: Storage used<br/>Operator: Greater than<br/>Aggregation type: Average<br/>Threshold value: 5 GB|  Alerts if the registry storage used exceeds a specified value.|

### Example: Send email alert when registry storage used exceeds a value

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your registry.
1. Select **Metrics** under **Monitoring**.
1. In the metrics explorer, in **Metric**, select **Storage used**.
