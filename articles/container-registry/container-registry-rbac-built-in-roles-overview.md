# Azure Container Registry Entra permissions and role assignments overview

Azure Container Registry (ACR) offers a set of [built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) that provide Microsoft Entra-based permissions management to an ACR registry.
Using [Azure role-based access control (RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/), you can assign a built-in role to users, managed identities, or service principals to grant Microsoft Entra-based permissions defined within the role.
You can also define and assign [custom roles](container-registry-rbac-custom-roles.md) with fine-grained permissions tailored to your specific needs if the built-in roles don't meet your requirements.

## Supported role assignment identity types

ACR roles can be assigned to the following identity types to grant permissions to a registry:
- [Individual user identity](container-registry-authentication.md#individual-login-with-azure-ad)
- [Managed identity for Azure resources](container-registry-authentication-managed-identity.md)
  - [Azure DevOps - Azure Pipelines identity](/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/containers/publish-to-acr)
  - [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node's kubelet identity](/azure/aks/cluster-container-registry-integration) to enable the AKS node to pull images from ACR. ACR supports role assignments for both [AKS-managed kubelet identity and AKS pre-created kubelet identity](/azure/aks/use-managed-identity) for AKS nodes to pull images from ACR.
  - [Azure Container Apps (ACA) identity](/azure/container-apps/managed-identity-image-pull)
  - [Azure Container Instances (ACI) identity](/azure/container-instances/using-azure-container-registry-mi)
  - [Azure Machine Learning (AML) workspace identity](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-identity-based-service-authentication)
  - [AML-attached Kubernetes cluster node kubelet identity](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-attach-kubernetes-to-workspace) to allow the Kubernetes cluster's nodes to pull images from ACR.
  - [AML online endpoint identity](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-access-resources-from-endpoints-managed-identities)
  - [Azure App Service identity](/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container)
  - [Azure Web Apps identity](/troubleshoot/azure/azure-container-registry/pull-image-to-web-app-fail)
  - [Azure Batch identity](/azure/batch/batch-docker-container-workloads)
  - [Azure Functions identity](/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings#acrusermanagedidentityid)
- [Service principal](container-registry-authentication.md#service-principal)
  - [AKS cluster service principal](authenticate-aks-cross-tenant.md) to enable AKS nodes to pull images from ACR. ACR also supports cross-tenant AKS node to ACR authentication through [cross-tenant service principal role assignments and authentication](authenticate-aks-cross-tenant.md).
  - [ACI service principal](container-registry-auth-aci.md)
  - [Hybrid or on-premises AKS clusters on Azure Stack Hub using service principal](/azure-stack/user/container-registry-deploy-image-aks-cluster)

Take note that [ACR connected registry](intro-connected-registry.md), ACR's on-premises registry offering that differs from cloud-based ACR, doesn't support Azure role assignments and Entra-based permissions management.

## Performing role assignments to grant permissions

See [Steps to add a role assignment](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps) for information on how to assign a role to an identity.
Role assignments can be made using:
- [Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal)
- [Azure CLI](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli)
- [Azure PowerShell](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell)

To perform role assignments, you must either have the `Owner` role or `Role Based Access Control Administrator` role on the registry.

## Scoping role assignments to specific repositories

You can use Microsoft Entra attribute-based access control (ABAC) for managing Microsoft Entra-based repository permissions.
This feature allows you to scope role assignments to specific repositories in a registry.

For an overview of Microsoft Entra ABAC repository permissions, including the ACR built-in roles that support Microsoft Entra ABAC conditions, see [Microsoft Entra-based repository permissions](container-registry-rbac-abac-repository-permissions.md).
Alternatively, you can consult the [Azure Container Registry roles directory reference](container-registry-rbac-built-in-roles-directory-reference.md) for a list of built-in roles that support Microsoft Entra ABAC conditions.

## Recommended built-in roles by scenario

Apply the principle of least privilege by assigning only the permissions necessary for an identity to perform its intended function.
These common scenarios each have a recommended built-in role.

> [!NOTE]
> The applicable built-in roles and role behavior depends on the registry's "Role assignment permissions mode". This is visible in the "Properties" blade in the Azure portal:
> - **RBAC Registry + ABAC Repository Permissions**: Supports standard RBAC role assignments with optional Microsoft Entra ABAC conditions to scope assignments to specific repositories.
> - **RBAC Registry Permissions**: Supports only standard RBAC assignments without ABAC conditions.
> For details on Microsoft Entra ABAC and ABAC-enabled roles, see [Microsoft Entra-based repository permissions](container-registry-rbac-abac-repository-permissions.md).
