# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to choose the appropriate service tier for my container registry, so that I can optimize storage, image throughput, and access capabilities based on my project's requirements."
---
> [!TIP]
> In this quickstart, you create a *Standard* registry, which is sufficient for most Azure Container Registry workflows. Choose other tiers for increased storage and image throughput, and capabilities such as connection using a [private endpoint](../container-registry-private-link.md). For details on available service tiers (SKUs), see [Container registry service tiers](../container-registry-skus.md).
