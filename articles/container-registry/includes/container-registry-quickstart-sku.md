> [!TIP]
> In this quickstart, you create a *Standard* registry, which is sufficient for most Azure Container Registry workflows. Choose other tiers for increased storage and image throughput, and capabilities such as connection using a [private endpoint](../container-registry-private-link.md). For details on available service tiers (SKUs), see [Container registry service tiers](../container-registry-skus.md).
