# Customer intent: "As a developer, I want to import and manage public container images in a private registry, so that I can enhance the reliability and security of my containerized applications."

> [!NOTE]
> The Dockerfile used in the following example depends on a public base container image from Docker Hub. To improve reliability when using public content, import and manage the image in a private Azure container registry, and update your Dockerfile to use your privately managed base image. [Learn more about working with public images](../buffer-gate-public-content.md).
