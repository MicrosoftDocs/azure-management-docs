# Enable artifact cache in your Azure Container Registry with Azure CLI

In this article, you learn how to use Azure CLI to enable the [artifact cache feature](artifact-cache-overview.md) in your Azure Container Registry (ACR) with or without authentication.

In addition to the prerequisites listed here, you need an Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Prerequisites

* Azure CLI. You can use the [Azure Cloud Shell][Azure Cloud Shell] or a local installation of Azure CLI to run the commands in this article. To use it locally, Azure CLI version 2.46.0 or later is required. To confirm your Azure CLI version, run `az --version`. To install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][Install Azure CLI].
* An existing ACR instance. If you don't already have one, [use our quickstart to create a new container registry](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-azure-cli).
* An existing Key Vault to [create and store credentials][create-and-store-keyvault-credentials].
* Permissions to [set and retrieve secrets from your Key Vault][set-and-retrieve-a-secret].

In this article, we use an example ACR instance named `MyRegistry`.

## Create the credentials

Before configuring the credentials, make sure you're able to [create and store secrets in the Azure Key Vault][create-and-store-keyvault-credentials] and [retrieve secrets from the Key Vault][set-and-retrieve-a-secret].

1. Run [`az acr credential set create`][az-acr-credential-set-create]:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az acr credential-set create 
   -r MyRegistry \
   -n MyDockerHubCredSet \
   -l docker.io \ 
   -u https://MyKeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/usernamesecret \
   -p https://MyKeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/passwordsecret
   ```

1. Run [`az acr credential set update`][az-acr-credential-set-update] to update the username or password Key Vault secret ID on the credential set:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az acr credential-set update -r MyRegistry -n MyDockerHubCredSet -p https://MyKeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/newsecretname
   ```

1. Run [az acr credential-set show][az-acr-credential-set-show] to show credentials:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az acr credential-set show -r MyRegistry -n MyDockerHubCredSet
   ```

## Create a cache rule

Next, create and configure the cache rule that pulls artifacts from the repository into your cache.

1. To create a new cache rule, run [`az acr cache create`][az-acr-cache-create]:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az acr cache create -r MyRegistry -n MyRule -s docker.io/library/ubuntu -t ubuntu -c MyDockerHubCredSet
   ```

1. To update credentials on the cache rule, run [`az acr cache update`][az-acr-cache-update]:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az acr cache update -r MyRegistry -n MyRule -c NewCredSet
    ```

    If you need to remove the credentials, run `az acr cache update -r MyRegistry -n MyRule --remove-cred-set`.

1. To show cache rules, run [`az acr cache show`][az-acr-cache-show]:

    ```azurecli-interactive
     az acr cache show -r MyRegistry -n MyRule
    ```

> [!TIP]
> To create a cache rule without using credentials, use the same command without credentials specified. For example, `az acr cache create --registry Myregistry --name MyRule --source-repo MySourceRepository --target-repo MyTargetRepository`. For some sources, such as Docker Hub, credentials are required to create a cache rule.

## Assign permissions to Key Vault with Azure RBAC

You can use Azure RBAC to assign the appropriate permissions to users so they can access the Azure Key Vault.

The `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/getSecret/action` permission is required to access the Key Vault. The **Key Vault Secrets User** Azure built-in role is typically granted, as it's the least privileged role that includes this action. Alternately, you can create a custom role that includes that permission.

The steps used vary depending on whether you're using Azure CLI or Bash.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Get the principal ID of the system identity in use to access Key Vault:

   ```azurecli
   az acr credential-set show --name MyCredentialSet --registry MyRegistry 
   ```

   Take note of the principal ID value, as you'll need it in step 3.

1. Display properties of the Key Vault to get its resource ID:

   ```azurecli
   az keyvault show --name MyKeyVaultName --resource-group MyResouceGroup
   ```

   You'll need this resource ID value for the next step.

1. Assign the **Key Vault Secrets User** role to the system identity of the credential set:

   ```azurecli
   az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Secrets User" --assignee CredentialSetPrincipalID --scope KeyVaultResourceID 

#### [Bash](#tab/bash)

1. Get the principal ID of the system identity in use to access Key Vault:

   ```bash
   CredentialSetPrincipalID=$(az acr credential-set show --name MyCredentialSet --registry MyRegistry  --query 'identity.principalId'  -o tsv
   ```

1. Display properties of the Key Vault to get its resource ID:

   ```bash
   KeyVaultResourceID=$(az keyvault show --name MyKeyVaultName --resource-group MyResouceGroup --query 'id' -o tsv
   ```

1. Assign the **Key Vault Secrets User** role to the system identity of the credential set:

   ```bash
   az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Secrets User" --assignee $CredentialSetPrincipalID --scope $KeyVaultResourceID
   ```

---

> [!TIP]
> Using the Key Vault's resource ID grants access to all secrets in the Key Vault. If you prefer, you can grant access only to the username and password secrets. To do so, instead of the command from step 2, run the following commands to retrieve only the username and password secrets:
>
> ```azurecli
> az keyvault secret show --vault-name MyKeyVaultName --name MyUsernameSecretName
> az keyvault secret show --vault-name MyKeyVaultName --name MyPasswordSecretName
> ```
>
> Next, perform step 3 twice, first replacing `KeyVaultResourceID` with the  ID of the username secret, then with the ID of the password secret.

## Assign permissions to Key Vault with access policies

Alternately, you can use access policies to assign permissions.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Get the principal ID of the system identity in use to access Key Vault:

   ```azurecli
   az acr credential-set show --name CredentialSet --registry MyRegistry
   ```

   Take note of the principal ID value, as you'll need it in the next step.

1. Run the `az keyvault set-policy` command to assign access to the Key Vault before pulling the image. For example, to assign permissions for the credentials to access the KeyVault secret:

   ```azurecli
   az keyvault set-policy --name MyKeyVault --object-id MyCredentialSetPrincipalID --secret-permissions get
   ```

#### [Bash](#tab/bash)

1. Get the principal ID of the system identity in use to access Key Vault:

   ```azurecli
   PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az acr credential-set show 
                   -name MyDockerHubCredSet \ 
                   -registry MyRegistry  \
                   --query 'identity.principalId' \ 
                   -o tsv) 
   ```

1. Run the `az keyvault set-policy` command to assign access to the Key Vault before pulling the image. For example, to assign permissions for the credentials to access the KeyVault secret:

   ```azurecli
   az keyvault set-policy --name MyKeyVault \
   --object-id $PRINCIPAL_ID \
   --secret-permissions get
   ```

---

## Pull your image

To pull an image from your cache, use the Docker command and provide the registry sign-in server name, repository name, and its desired tag. For example, to pull an image from the repository `hello-world` with desired tag `latest` for the registry sign-in server `myregistry.azurecr.io`, run:

```azurecli-interactive
 docker pull myregistry.azurecr.io/hello-world:latest
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the cache rule and credentials that you created.

1. To delete the cache rule, run [`az acr cache delete`][az-acr-cache-delete]:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az acr cache delete -r MyRegistry -n MyRule
   ```

1. To delete the credentials, run [`az acr credential-set delete`][az-acr-credential-set-delete]:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az acr credential-set delete -r MyRegistry -n MyDockerHubCredSet
   ```
