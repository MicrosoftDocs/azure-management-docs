# Customer intent: As a cloud developer, I want to configure an Azure Container Registry task with a managed identity, so that I can pull images from another private registry without managing credentials.

# Cross-registry authentication in an ACR task using an Azure-managed identity 

In an [ACR task](container-registry-tasks-overview.md), you can [enable a managed identity for Azure resources](container-registry-tasks-authentication-managed-identity.md). The task can use the identity to access other Azure resources, without needing to provide or manage credentials. 

In this article, you learn how to enable a managed identity in a task to pull an image from a registry different from the one used to run the task.

To create the Azure resources, this article requires that you run the Azure CLI version 2.0.68 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli].

## Scenario overview

The example task pulls a base image from another Azure container registry to build and push an application image. To pull the base image, you configure the task with a managed identity and assign appropriate permissions to it. 

This example shows steps using either a user-assigned or system-assigned managed identity. Your choice of identity depends on your organization's needs.

In a real-world scenario, an organization might maintain a set of base images used by all development teams to build their applications. These base images are stored in a corporate registry, with each development team having only pull rights. 

## Prerequisites

For this article, you need two Azure container registries:

* You use the first registry to create and execute ACR tasks. In this article, this registry is named *myregistry*. 
* The second registry hosts a base image used for the task to build an image. In this article, the second registry is named *mybaseregistry*. 

Replace with your own registry names in later steps.

If you don't already have the needed Azure container registries, see [Quickstart: Create a private container registry using the Azure CLI](container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md). You don't need to push images to the registry yet.

## Prepare base registry

For demonstration purposes, as a one-time operation, run [az acr import][az-acr-import] to import a public Node.js image from Docker Hub to your base registry. In practice, another team or process in the organization might maintain images in the base registry.

```azurecli
az acr import --name mybaseregistry \
  --source docker.io/library/node:15-alpine \
  --image baseimages/node:15-alpine 
```

## Define task steps in YAML file

The steps for this example [multi-step task](container-registry-tasks-multi-step.md) are defined in a [YAML file](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md). Create a file named `helloworldtask.yaml` in your local working directory and paste the following contents. Update the value of `REGISTRY_NAME` in the build step with the server name of your base registry.

```yml
version: v1.1.0
steps:
# Replace mybaseregistry with the name of your registry containing the base image
  - build: -t $Registry/hello-world:$ID  https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-build-helloworld-node.git#main -f Dockerfile-app --build-arg REGISTRY_NAME=mybaseregistry.azurecr.io
  - push: ["$Registry/hello-world:$ID"]
```

The build step uses the `Dockerfile-app` file in the [Azure-Samples/acr-build-helloworld-node](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-build-helloworld-node.git) repo to build an image. The `--build-arg` references the base registry to pull the base image. When successfully built, the image is pushed to the registry used to run the task.

## Option 1: Create task with user-assigned identity

The steps in this section create a task and enable a user-assigned identity. If you want to enable a system-assigned identity instead, see [Option 2: Create task with system-assigned identity](#option-2-create-task-with-system-assigned-identity). 

[!INCLUDE [container-registry-tasks-user-assigned-id](./includes/container-registry-tasks-user-assigned-id.md)]

### Create task

Create the task *helloworldtask* by executing the following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command. The task runs without a source code context, and the command references the file `helloworldtask.yaml` in the working directory. The `--assign-identity` parameter passes the resource ID of the user-assigned identity. 

```azurecli
az acr task create \
  --registry myregistry \
  --name helloworldtask \
  --context /dev/null \
  --file helloworldtask.yaml \
  --assign-identity $resourceID
```

[!INCLUDE [container-registry-tasks-user-id-properties](./includes/container-registry-tasks-user-id-properties.md)]

### Give identity pull permissions to the base registry

In this section, give the managed identity permissions to pull from the base registry, *mybaseregistry*.

Use the [az acr show][az-acr-show] command to get the resource ID of the base registry and store it in a variable:

```azurecli
baseregID=$(az acr show --name mybaseregistry --query id --output tsv)
```

Use the [az role assignment create][az-role-assignment-create] command to assign the identity the correct role to the base registry. This role assignment grants permissions to only pull images from the registry.

The correct role to use in the role assignment depends on whether the registry is [ABAC-enabled or not](container-registry-rbac-abac-repository-permissions.md).

```azurecli
ROLE="Container Registry Repository Reader" # For ABAC-enabled registries. For non-ABAC registries, use AcrPull.
az role assignment create \
  --assignee $principalID \
  --scope $baseregID \
  --role "$ROLE"
```

Proceed to [Add target registry credentials to task](#add-target-registry-credentials-to-task).

## Option 2: Create task with system-assigned identity

The steps in this section create a task and enable a system-assigned identity. If you want to enable a user-assigned identity instead, see [Option 1: Create task with user-assigned identity](#option-1-create-task-with-user-assigned-identity). 

### Create task

Create the task *helloworldtask* by executing the following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command. The task runs without a source code context, and the command references the file `helloworldtask.yaml` in the working directory. The `--assign-identity` parameter with no value enables the system-assigned identity on the task. 

```azurecli
az acr task create \
  --registry myregistry \
  --name helloworldtask \
  --context /dev/null \
  --file helloworldtask.yaml \
  --assign-identity 
```
[!INCLUDE [container-registry-tasks-system-id-properties](./includes/container-registry-tasks-system-id-properties.md)]

### Give identity pull permissions to the base registry

In this section, give the managed identity permissions to pull from the base registry, *mybaseregistry*.

Use the [az acr show][az-acr-show] command to get the resource ID of the base registry and store it in a variable:

```azurecli
baseregID=$(az acr show --name mybaseregistry --query id --output tsv)
```

Use the [az role assignment create][az-role-assignment-create] command to assign the identity the correct role to the base registry. This role assignment grants permissions to only pull images from the registry.

The correct role to use in the role assignment depends on whether the registry is [ABAC-enabled or not](container-registry-rbac-abac-repository-permissions.md).

```azurecli
ROLE="Container Registry Repository Reader" # For ABAC-enabled registries. For non-ABAC registries, use AcrPull.
az role assignment create \
  --assignee $principalID \
  --scope $baseregID \
  --role "$ROLE"
```

## Add target registry credentials to task

Now use the [az acr task credential add][az-acr-task-credential-add] command to enable the task to authenticate with the base registry using the identity's credentials. Run the command corresponding to the type of managed identity you enabled in the task. If you enabled a user-assigned identity, pass `--use-identity` with the client ID of the identity. If you enabled a system-assigned identity, pass `--use-identity [system]`.

```azurecli
# Add credentials for user-assigned identity to the task
az acr task credential add \
  --name helloworldtask \
  --registry myregistry \
  --login-server mybaseregistry.azurecr.io \
  --use-identity $clientID

# Add credentials for system-assigned identity to the task
az acr task credential add \
  --name helloworldtask \
  --registry myregistry \
  --login-server mybaseregistry.azurecr.io \
  --use-identity [system]
```

## Manually run the task

To verify that the task in which you enabled a managed identity runs successfully, manually trigger the task with the [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run] command. 

```azurecli
az acr task run \
  --name helloworldtask \
  --registry myregistry
```

If the task runs successfully, output is similar to:
