# Wildcard support for artifact cache in Azure Container Registry

Wildcard use asterisks (*) to match multiple paths within the container image registry. This article lists the wildcards supported by the [artifact cache feature](artifact-cache-overview.md) for Azure Container Registry (ACR).

> [!NOTE]
> Cache rules map from `target repository` => `source repository`.

## Registry level wildcard

The registry level wildcard lets you cache all repositories from an upstream registry.

| Cache rule                                  | Mapping                                  | Example                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contoso.azurecr.io/*` => `mcr.microsoft.com/*` | Mapping for all images under ACR to MCR. | `contoso.azurecr.io/myapp/image1` => `mcr.microsoft.com/myapp/image1<br>contoso.azurecr.io/myapp/image2` => `mcr.microsoft.com/myapp/image2` |

## Repository level wildcard

The repository level wildcard lets you cache all repositories from an upstream registry mapping to the repository prefix.

| Cache Rule                                                                                                                              | Mapping                                                                                     | Example                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contoso.azurecr.io/dotnet/*` => `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/*`                                                                               | Mapping specific repositories under ACR to corresponding repositories in MCR.               | `contoso.azurecr.io/dotnet/sdk` => `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk`<br>`contoso.azurecr.io/dotnet/runtime` => `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime`             |
| `contoso.azurecr.io/library/dotnet/*` => `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/*` <br>`contoso.azurecr.io/library/python/*` => `docker.io/library/python/`* | Mapping specific repositories under ACR to repositories from different upstream registries. | `contoso.azurecr.io/library/dotnet/app1` => `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/app1` <br>`contoso.azurecr.io/library/python/app3` => `docker.io/library/python/app3` |

## Limitations for wildcard-based cache rules

Wildcard cache rules use asterisks (*) to match multiple paths within the container image registry. These rules can't overlap with other wildcard cache rules. In other words, if you have a wildcard cache rule for a certain registry path, you can't add another wildcard rule that overlaps with it.

Here are some examples of overlapping rules:

**Example 1**:

Existing cache rule: `contoso.azurecr.io/* => mcr.microsoft.com/*`<br>
New cache being added: `contoso.azurecr.io/library/* => docker.io/library/*`<br>

The addition of the new cache rule is blocked because the target repository path `contoso.azurecr.io/library/*` overlaps with the existing wildcard rule `contoso.azurecr.io/*`.

**Example 2:**

Existing cache rule: `contoso.azurecr.io/library/*` => `mcr.microsoft.com/library/*`<br>
New cache being added: `contoso.azurecr.io/library/dotnet/*` => `docker.io/library/dotnet/*`<br>

The addition of the new cache rule is blocked because the target repository path `contoso.azurecr.io/library/dotnet/*` overlaps with the existing wildcard rule  `contoso.azurecr.io/library/*`.

## Limitations for static/fixed cache rules

Static or fixed cache rules are more specific and don't use wildcards. They can potentially overlap with wildcard-based cache rules. If a cache rule specifies a fixed repository path, then it allows overlapping with a wildcard-based cache rule.

**Example 1**:

Existing cache rule: `contoso.azurecr.io/*` => `mcr.microsoft.com/*`<br>
New cache being added: `contoso.azurecr.io/library/dotnet` => `docker.io/library/dotnet`<br>

The addition of the new cache rule is allowed because `contoso.azurecr.io/library/dotnet` is a static path and can overlap with the wildcard cache rule `contoso.azurecr.io/*`.
