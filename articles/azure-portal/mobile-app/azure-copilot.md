# Use Azure Copilot with the Azure mobile app

[Azure Copilot](/azure/copilot/overview) is an AI-powered tool that helps you do more with Azure. Azure Copilot uses large language models (LLMs) and insights about your Azure environment to help you work more efficiently. You can access Azure Copilot from within the Azure mobile app, as well as in the Azure portal.

Azure Copilot can help you explore the range of services and resources that Azure offers and find the best ones for your needs. You can ask questions in natural language and get personalized information based on your own Azure resources and environment. Azure Copilot can also help you achieve your goals by generating code snippets and suggestions.
