# Use Azure Copilot with the Azure mobile app

[Azure Copilot](/azure/copilot/overview) is an AI-powered tool that lets you do more with Azure. Azure Copilot uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and insights about your Azure environment to help you work more efficiently. You can use the Azure mobile app to access Azure Copilot and benefit from its features.

With Azure Copilot, you can explore the range of services and resources that Azure offers and find the best ones for your needs. You can ask questions in natural language and get personalized information based on your own Azure resources and environment. Azure Copilot can also help you achieve your goals by generating code snippets and suggestions.

To learn more about Azure Copilot, see [What is Azure Copilot?](/azure/copilot/overview) and [Responsible AI FAQ for Azure Copilot](/azure/copilot/responsible-ai-faq).

## Access Azure Copilot on the Azure mobile app

In the Azure Mobile app, select the **Copilot** icon to launch Azure Copilot. The first time you use Azure Copilot, a welcome screen tells you more about the feature and how to use it.

To start a conversation with Azure Copilot, just type or speak your query or command in natural language. You can also use the provided prompts that appear above the keyboard in the mobile app. These prompts are based on common tasks and your Azure environment. Azure Copilot responds with relevant information, code snippets, or suggestions that you can utilize to monitor and manage your resources. When needed, it prompts you to provide more information or select a specific resource.
