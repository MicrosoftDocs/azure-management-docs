# Azure mobile app Home

Azure mobile app **Home** surfaces the most essential information and the resources you use most often. It provides a convenient way to access and manage your Azure resources or your Microsoft Entra tenant from your mobile device.

## Display cards

Azure mobile app **Home** consists of customizable display cards that show information and let you quickly access frequently used resources and services. You can select and organize these cards depending on what's most important for you and how you want to use the app.

Current card options include:

- **Learn**: Explore the [most popular Microsoft learn modules for Azure](learn-training.md).
- **Resource groups**: Quick access to all your resource groups.
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Quick access to [Microsoft Entra ID management](microsoft-entra-id.md).
- **Azure services**: Quick access to Virtual machines, Web Apps, SQL databases, and Application Insights.
- **Latest alerts**: A list and chart view of the alerts fired in the last 24 hours and the option to [see all notifications](alerts-notifications.md).
- **Service Health**: A current count of service issues, maintenance, health advisories, and security advisories.
- **Cloud Shell**: Quick access to the [Cloud Shell terminal](cloud-shell.md).
- **Recent resources**: A list of your four most recently viewed resources, with the option to see all.
- **Favorites**: A list of the resources you've added to your favorites, and the option to see all.
- **Dashboards (preview)**: Access to [shared dashboards](../dashboard-hub.md).

You also see the **Copilot** icon, which you can use to [launch Azure Copilot](azure-copilot.md).

## Customize Azure mobile app Home

You can customize the cards displayed on your Azure mobile app **Home** by selecting the three dots near the top of **Home**, then selecting **Customize Home**. From there, select which cards you want to see by toggling the switch. You can also drag and drop the display cards in the list to reorder how they appear on your **Home**.

For example, you could rearrange the default order as follows:

This customization results in the following layout:

## Global search

The global search button appears near the top of **Home**. You can use this to search for anything specific, such as:

- Resources
- Services
- Resource groups
- Subscriptions

## Filtering

You can filter the information and search results shown on **Home** by one or more specific subscriptions. This filtering option is specific to **Home**, and it doesn't filter results for the other sections.

To do so, in the upper right of **Home**, select the three dots and then select **Filter**. Your selection will apply to information shown in the following sections:

- Resource groups
- Azure services
- Latest alerts
- Service health
- Global search
