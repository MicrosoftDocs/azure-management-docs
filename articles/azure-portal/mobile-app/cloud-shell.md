# Use Cloud Shell in the Azure mobile app

The Azure Cloud Shell feature in the Azure mobile app provides an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible terminal for managing Azure resources.

You can execute commands in Cloud Shell through either Bash or PowerShell, and you can switch shells anytime.

## Access Cloud Shell in the Azure mobile app

To launch Cloud Shell from within the Azure mobile app, select the **Cloud Shell** card on the [Azure mobile app **Home**](home.md). If you don't see the **Cloud Shell** card, you may need to scroll down. You can rearrange the order in which cards are displayed by selecting the **Edit** (pencil) icon on Azure mobile app **Home**.

## Set up storage account

Cloud Shell requires a storage account to be associated with your sessions, unless you set up [ephemeral sessions](/azure/cloud-shell/get-started/ephemeral)). If you already set up a storage account for Cloud shell, or you opted to use ephemeral sessions, that selection is remembered when you launch Cloud Shell in the Azure mobile app.

If you haven't used Cloud Shell before, you're prompted to select a subscription in which a new storage account will be created for you.
