# Manage favorites

The **Favorites** list in the Azure portal lets you quickly go to the services you use most often. We've already added some common services to your **Favorites** list, but you can customize it by adding or removing items. You're the only one who sees the changes you make to **Favorites**.

You can view your **Favorites** list in the Azure portal menu, or from the **Favorites** section within **All services**.

## Add a favorite service

Items that are listed under **Favorites** are selected from **All services**. Within **All services**, you can hover over a service name to display information and resources related to the service. A filled star icon ![Filled star icon](./media/azure-portal-add-remove-sort-favorites/azure-portal-favorites-graystar.png) next to the service name indicates that the item appears in the **Favorites** list. If the star icon isn't filled in for a service, select the star icon to add it to your **Favorites** list.

This example shows how to add **Azure Migrate** to the **Favorites** list.

1. Select **All services** from the Azure portal menu.

1. Enter "migrate" in the **Filter services** field near the top of the **All services** pane. The portal shows services that have "migrate" in the title or as a keyword.

1. Hover over the service name and select the star icon.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-portal-add-remove-sort-favorites/azure-portal-favorites-add.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the star icon to add a service to Favorites in the Azure portal.":::

1. **Azure Migrate** is now added to your **Favorites** list.

## Rearrange your favorite services

In the **Favorites** section within **All services**, your favorite services are shown in alphabetical order. However, you can customize the order in which services appear within the **Favorites** list in the Azure portal menu.

To move a favorite service to a different position, select the new service, then drag and drop it to the desired location. Continue to drag and drop any service in your **Favorites** list until you're happy with the order.

## Remove an item from Favorites

You can remove items directly from the **Favorites** list.

1. In the **Favorites** section of the portal menu, or within the **Favorites** section of **All services**, hover over the name of the service you want to remove.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-portal-add-remove-sort-favorites/azure-portal-favorites-remove.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to remove a service from Favorites in the Azure portal.":::

1. On the information card, select the star so that it changes from filled to unfilled.

The service is then removed from your **Favorites** list.
