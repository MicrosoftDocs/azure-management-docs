# Supported devices

The [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) is a web-based console that runs in the browser of all modern desktops and tablet devices. To use the portal, you must have JavaScript enabled on your browser. We recommend not using ad blockers in your browser, because they may cause issues with some portal features.

## Recommended browsers

We recommend using the most up-to-date browser that's compatible with your operating system. The following browsers are supported:

* Microsoft Edge (latest version)
* Safari (latest version, Mac only)
* Chrome (latest version)
* Firefox (latest version)

## Mobile app

To manage Azure resources from a mobile device, try the [Azure mobile app](mobile-app/overview.md). It's available for iOS and Android.
