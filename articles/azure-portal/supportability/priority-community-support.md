# Priority community support (PCS) for Azure developer support plan customers 

Starting February 12, 2025, we enhanced the **Azure Developer Support Plan** by introducing **Priority Community Support (PCS)** as the **first line of support** in the **Azure portal**. This change is part of our ongoing effort to streamline support services and provide faster, more efficient assistance for customers using Azure.

## What is changing?

With the introduction of PCS, Developer Support Plan customers will now receive high-quality answers to their technical Azure-related questions directly on Microsoft Q&A. This service is managed by Azure engineers, Community Experts, and Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs), ensuring that inquiries are addressed by knowledgeable professionals. 

Customers can expect responses within 8 business hours for Severity C requests, maintaining the same initial response time as before. This adjustment aims to efficiently address "how-to" inquiries and common technical questions in a public forum, allowing the broader community to benefit from shared knowledge.

For complex issues that can't be resolved through the Q&A platform, our engineers will seamlessly escalate the matter by creating a support ticket on the customer's behalf, ensuring that more intricate problems receive the attention they require.

This new approach brings several key benefits: 

- Faster Responses: Get responses within **eight business hours**, improving response efficiency. 
- Expert Knowledge: Technical insights are provided by Azure engineers, Community Champions, and MVPs with deep subject-matter expertise. 
- Knowledge Sharing: Answers will be visible to other customers, helping the broader community find solutions faster. 
- Seamless Escalation: If an issue requires further investigation, our engineers will escalate the case and **create a support ticket on your behalf**. 

## How to access priority community support (PCS)?

Customers with the Azure Developer Support Plan can access PCS in two ways: 

- Via the Azure portal 

   - Navigate to **Support + Troubleshooting** 
   - Select **Create a Support Request**
   - Choose **Get Support on Microsoft Q&A** 

- Via Microsoft Learn 

   - Sign in with the account linked to your **Azure Developer Support Plan**
   - Post your technical question on **Microsoft Q&A** with the appropriate Azure service tag

## Handle customer-specific data and privacy

We understand that some technical issues require **sharing sensitive information**, such as **logs, account details, or confidential data**. To **protect customer privacy**, we follow these best practices:

- **Private Message**: If additional details are required, a Microsoft engineer will **reach out to you privately** to collect necessary information.
- **No Public Data Sharing**: Sensitive customer information **will never be shared publicly** on **Microsoft Q&A**. Our engineers will guide you to a secure channel for troubleshooting when needed.

## What if my issue requires a support ticket? 

While most "how-to" questions will be resolved within Microsoft Q&A, we recognize that some complex issues require deeper investigation. 

- For such cases, our engineers will create a support ticket on your behalf, ensuring smooth escalation without requiring you to initiate it manually. 
- Existing support tickets will continue as usual, but all new technical inquiries must be posted on Microsoft Q&A.

## Can I still create a support ticket for non-technical issues? 

Customers with an **Azure Developer Support Plan** can still create tickets for **non-technical issues, including: 

- Billing & Subscription Issues 
- Quota Increases 
- Service Limit Adjustments 

## Upgrade to a higher-tier support plan

The Developer Support Plan covers **trial and non-production environments** with minimal business impact (**Severity C**). If you need faster or 24/7 support, consider upgrading: 

- Navigate to **Help + Support** in the Azure portal 
- Select **Upgrade Support Plan** 
- Choose from **Standard** or **Professional Direct** plans
