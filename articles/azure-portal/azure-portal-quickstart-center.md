# Get started with the Azure Quickstart Center

Azure Quickstart Center is a guided experience in the Azure portal that helps you improve your Azure knowledge. For organizations new to Azure, it's the fastest way to set up a cloud environment.

## Use Quickstart Center

To use Quickstart Center, first sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Then, in the search bar, type "Quickstart Center", and select it.

You can also go to Quickstart Center by selecting **All services** from the Azure portal menu. Then select **General** from the service menu. Scroll down to **Get started**, and select **Quickstart Center**.

Quickstart Center shows three sections: **Get started**, **Projects and guides**, and **Take an online course**.

## Get started

If you're new to Azure, use the **Starter checklist** in the **Get started** tab to get familiar with some basic tasks and services. Select **Start**, then work through the checklist. Videos and links help you learn about topics like using basic account features, estimating costs, and deploying different types of resources.

## Create

The **Create** section helps you explore popular Azure services and start your own projects.

**Popular services** is a quick way to explore services like virtual machines and web apps. Select a link to quickly create a resource and start working with Azure services.

**Popular solutions** shows end-to-end solutions that often use multiple Azure services. These solutions use an interactive deployment experience to help you set up resources for scenarios like hosting a website or creating a virtual desktop infrastructure.

## Learn

Use the resources in the **Learn** section to build your Azure skills.

**Guides** help you plan for your organization's success with Azure using the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework guides. Designed for the IT admin and cloud architect, these guides walk you through deployment scenarios to help you set up, manage, and secure your Azure environment, including migrating workloads to Azure.

**Training**  highlights free introductory course modules. Select a tile to launch a course and learn more about cloud concepts and managing resources in Azure. You can also browse the full Azure catalog to see all courses, learning paths, and modules.
