# Get started with the Azure Quickstart Center

Azure Quickstart Center is a guided experience in the Azure portal to help you improve your Azure knowledge. For organizations new to Azure, it's the fastest way to set up a cloud environment.

## Use Quickstart Center

To use Quickstart center, first sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Then, in the search bar, type "Quickstart Center", and then select it.

You can also navigate to Quickstart Center by selecting **All services** from the Azure portal menu, then selecting **General** from the service menu. Scroll down to **Get started**, then select **Quickstart Center**.

Quickstart Center shows three tabs: **Get started**, **Projects and guides**, and **Take an online course**.

## Get started

If you're new to Azure, use the checklist in the **Get started** to get familiar with some basic tasks and services. Watch videos and use the links to explore more about topics like using basic account features, estimating costs, and deploying different types of resources.

## Projects and guides

The **Projects and guides** tab has two sections:

* **Start a project**: If you're ready to create a resource, this section lets you learn more about your choices before you commit to an option. Select **Start** for any service to see options, learn more about scenarios, explore costs, and identify prerequisites. After making your choices, you can complete your deployment.

* **Setup guides**: Designed for the IT admin and cloud architect, these guides introduce key concepts for Azure adoption. Structured steps help you take action as you learn, applying Microsoft's recommended best practices. Our guides walk you through deployment scenarios to help you set up, manage, and secure your Azure environment, including migrating workloads to Azure.

## Take an online course

The **Take an online course** tab of the Azure Quickstart Center highlights free introductory course modules.

Select a tile to launch a course and learn more about cloud concepts and managing resources in Azure. You can also select **Browse** to see all courses, learning paths and modules.
