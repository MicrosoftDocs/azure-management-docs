# Azure Lighthouse and the Cloud Solution Provider program

If you're a [CSP (Cloud Solution Provider)](/partner-center/csp-overview) partner, you can already access the Azure subscriptions created for your customers through the CSP program by using the Administer On Behalf Of (AOBO) functionality. This access allows you to directly support, configure, and manage your customers' subscriptions.

With [Azure Lighthouse](../overview.md), you can use Azure delegated resource management along with AOBO. This helps improve security and reduces unnecessary access by enabling more granular permissions for your users. It also allows for greater efficiency and scalability, as your users can work across multiple customer subscriptions using a single login in your tenant.

> [!TIP]
> To help safeguard customer resources, be sure to review and follow our [recommended security practices](recommended-security-practices.md) along with the [partner security requirements](/partner-center/partner-security-requirements).

## Administer on Behalf of (AOBO)

With AOBO, any user with the [Admin Agent](/partner-center/account-settings/permissions-overview#admin-agent-role) role in your tenant has AOBO access to Azure subscriptions that you create through the CSP program. Any users who need access to any customers' subscriptions must be a member of this group. AOBO doesnâ€™t allow the flexibility to create distinct groups that work with different customers, or to enable different roles for groups or users.

## Azure Lighthouse

Using Azure Lighthouse, you can assign different groups to different customers or roles, as shown in the following diagram. Because users can be granted the necessary level of access through [Azure delegated resource management](architecture.md), you can reduce the number of users who have the Admin Agent role (and thus have full AOBO access).

Azure Lighthouse helps improve security by limiting unnecessary access to your customers' resources. It also gives you more flexibility to manage multiple customers at scale, using the [Azure built-in role](tenants-users-roles.md#role-support-for-azure-lighthouse) that's most appropriate for each user's duties, without granting a user more access than necessary.

To further minimize the number of permanent assignments, you can [create eligible authorizations](../how-to/create-eligible-authorizations.md) to grant additional permissions to your users on a just-in-time basis.

Onboarding a subscription that you created through the CSP program follows the steps described in [Onboard a customer to Azure Lighthouse](../how-to/onboard-customer.md). Any user who has the Admin Agent role in the customer's tenant can perform this onboarding.

> [!TIP]
> [Managed Service offers](managed-services-offers.md) with private plans aren't supported with subscriptions established through a reseller of the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program. Instead, you can onboard these subscriptions to Azure Lighthouse by [using Azure Resource Manager templates](../how-to/onboard-customer.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The [**My customers** page in the Azure portal](../how-to/view-manage-customers.md) now includes a **Cloud Solution Provider (Preview)** section, which displays billing info and resources for CSP customers who have [signed the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)](/partner-center/confirm-customer-agreement) and are [under the Azure plan](/partner-center/azure-plan-get-started). For more info, see [Get started with your Microsoft Partner Agreement billing account](/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/mpa-overview).
>
> CSP customers may appear in this section whether or not they're also onboarded to Azure Lighthouse. If so, they also appear in the **Customers** section, as described in [View and manage customers and delegated resources](../how-to/view-manage-customers.md). Similarly, a CSP customer does not have to appear in the **Cloud Solution Provider (Preview)** section of **My customers** in order for you to onboard them to Azure Lighthouse.

## Link your partner ID to track your impact on delegated resources

Members of the [Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/) can link a partner ID with the credentials used to manage delegated customer resources. This link allows Microsoft to identify and recognize partners who drive Azure customer success. It also allows [CSP (Cloud Solution Provider)](/partner-center/csp-overview) partners to receive [partner earned credit (PEC)](/partner-center/partner-earned-credit) for customers who have [signed the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)](/partner-center/confirm-customer-agreement) and are [under the Azure plan](/partner-center/azure-plan-get-started).

To earn recognition for Azure Lighthouse activities, you'll need to [link your partner ID](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/link-partner-id) with at least one user account in your managing tenant, and ensure that the linked account has access to each of your onboarded subscriptions. For simplicity, we recommend creating a service principal account in your tenant, associating it with your Partner ID, then granting it access to every customer you onboard with an [Azure built-in role that is eligible for partner earned credit](/partner-center/azure-roles-perms-pec).

For more information, see [Link a partner ID](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/link-partner-id).
